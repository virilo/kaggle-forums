"I was away for couple of months and I am so happy to be back for my regular cocotte meal, after collecting from the restaurant everything was as great and perfect than eating in. Juicy chicken, fresh side, amazing mash potato.What a great dinner at home again thanks to COCOTTE."
"I recently ordered over the phone from Cocotte to collect for a gathering at home. On calling the restaurant for the delivery, the service was polite, well communicated and friendly. The person on the phone had a great knowledge of the menu and gave helpful suggestions for customer favourites. The food was ready to collect swiftly at the time we requested and was well packaged for the journey home. The food itself traveled well which is fantastic, the food remained warm and as tasty as when we've eaten on site. All in all what a fabulous night made perfect by Cocottes tasty food and efficient service."
"Came here because we missed our table at Farmacy across the road. The waitress accommodated us within 10 minutes and offered suitable vegan food. No lager on tap but not the end of the world. Enjoyed everything. 2 people, 4 dishes, 2 cocktails and 2 beers came to £62 which seemed reasonable for this area in London. Would certainly come back for a snack."
"My first time in cocotte and was amazed by how friendly this member of front of house staff Julia was. From I entered, during our meal and until we left. My partner was left delighted at how attentive she was and we will definitely come back again"

Great food and quality of the products. Its a perfect place to go on a family dinner. Definitely recommend it
My husband and I visited for the first time this month and we had a brilliant experience. First time eating out since lockdown but the procedures the staff had in place made us feel relaxed and welcome.  I loved the truffle croquet and beetroot salad! Would definitely order this again. Great menu selection and staff were attentive.  Thanks for a great experience!
"Visited Cocotte with family in July and it was a very pleasant dining experience. We were seated very quickly as we made a reservation and the waiter took our drinks order as we decided on main dishes to order.  I ordered the Cocotte Ceaser Salad, and it was the best Ceaser Salad I have tasted, the chicken was well seasoned and cooked to perfection. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. "
"We had a fantastic meal at cocotte with friends - our first meal in a restaurant since lockdown - and it couldn’t have been better. Our waitress Valentina created the most relaxing environment, she went above and beyond and provided us with the best service (I’ve eaten at a lot of places varying from 3 Michelin stars and Valentina is probably one of the best waitresses I’ve ever seen!!). Her hosting skills really made us forget the pandemic. The food was fantastic. I highly recommend the truffle mac & cheese and the foie gras croquette (I don’t usually like foie gras!).  Excellent all around, brilliant quality, good value for money but most of all faultless service - thank you to team Cocotte! "
"If you really liked the chicken you really need to go. They have amazing, side and the best cocktails very friendly, staff thank you!!"
"We thoroughly enjoyed our time on The Prince Regent.  Food was very good and included great attention to food intolerances.  Service was excellent - knowledgable, informative, friendly, and entertaining! Very rare do I think gratuity is so deserved.  Really nice aperitif.  Wine was an interesting but good selection.  A great way to see the views from the canal boat.  Any other points... we’d prefer not to use the very same cutlery for all four savoury courses, even if they could be changed just once would be nicer, and we appreciate washing up on a boat isn’t easy.  And the drinks are a bit expensive.  But overall, recommend. "
"Myself and hubby were bought a voucher for this cruise. We used it on Saturday. What can I say except it is wonderful! Our host Steph was very professional, funny and charming. She was very professional explaining everything about the cruise and Covid rules. We went for the wine pairing with the dishes at £55 a head was great to do but next time we’ll order by bottle. We didn’t like one of the wines and Ollie our wine waiter exchanged it and gave us something different... The food is a 5 course set menu with no alternatives. The first 2 courses bear in mind are sharing courses. Then you get your own course 3, 4 then own dessert. Luckily all the courses were delicious and we enjoyed each and everyone. The sail is really nice and we had perfect weather. They have 2 toilets onboard. This was my only gripe... it’s not easy to see how to flush, I only found out as someone asked whilst I was in one and I heard, every time I went the toilet the loo was not flushed!! Not great to see. Definitely think in the briefing they give us all at the beginning they need to tell people we’re the flush is!  This isn’t a cheap meal but we still loved it and definitely will do it again!  Absolutely recommend "
"The crew on the boat were very welcoming and created a relaxed and informal atmosphere, and were very friendly. My wife was on crutches after breaking her ankle, but they helped her on and off the boat with care and consideration. The food was amazing, so tasty and perfectly cooked. The boat lazily cruised along the canal, and the scenery of big houses and other boats was interesting too. It felt very peaceful and relaxing in the heart of London. The wines were brilliant, and the wine waiter knew his wines well. Altogether an experience we can't wait to repeat. I thoroughly recommend it."
"One of the best restaurant in Heart of London . Nice restaurant, delicious food, stuff are very friendly, I’m definitely coming back."
"We had lunch onboard the Prince Regent this afternoon and the whole experience was wonderful. We couldn’t fault the service or the food. The attention to detail on the service was second to none, one of hosts noticed at the beginning that I hadn’t drunk my aperitif and brought me over a delicious non- alcoholic alternative of sparkling tea instead (which was excellent) My personal highlight of the tasting menu was the Cornish crab & peach gazpacho. A great alternative lunch treat in London!"
"We ordered 2 set of meze - £22 per person. The food wasn’t disappointing but definitely the portion size. Been to many Greek restaurants for meze and paying the same price but I have never seen such small selection and potion sizes. I thought it was a joke and asked the waiter and he was rather rude. If you would like to go somewhere to have a weight watcher’s birthday celebration, this is the place.  Food is good but value for money is extremely poor! No doubt to say, in any hurry to come back."
We boarded the Prince Regent last Sunday for their lunchtime cruise and was greeted by Leah who gave us a welcome glass of Somerset cider brandy with sour dough bread and anchovy butter mousse - a perfect appetizer. You can wander outside at the front of the barge between courses to look at the big houses and houseboats but then we were back inside for the first course of fish and chips (the best batter I have ever tasted ) with a chilled glass of Semillon. The next course of Cured Char (a first) with pickles preceded the wonderful combination of cornish crab with peach gazpacho and then the main dish of Hake cooked to perfection. We drank Rose Txakoli from the Basque region of Spain. The desert of Ricotta cheesecake with macerated Madeira strawberries rounded off a wonderful afternoon which was a really lovely experience. The service from Leah and Niamh was first class as was Stuart's cooking. The Captain steered the boat brilliantly through the narrow tunnels. We will now try The Grand Duchess static barge restaurant.
"This was such a fabulous experience from start to finish. The Prince Regent is a lovely barge, and has been arranged to enable everyone to feel very comfortable and safe. The 5 course set lunch was absolutely delicious, best food we’ve eaten for a long time. I tried several different glasses of wine, including one made in Bethnal Green! All were very good! The service is excellent, and you are made to feel very welcome. The views are really interesting, going through Little Venice, past London Zoo, then turning at Camden Lock and returning back the same way. I really can’t wait to return. They are very easy to find, just take the Sheldon Square exit from Paddington Station, and the Prince Regent is a two minute walk along the canal. Thank you for making my birthday special."
This was a first choice of a ladies lunch after 4 months of lockdown. It did not disappoint.  We had to pay in advance which I was fine with as in these times the restaurants are in survival mode.  Harry greeted us in a warm and extremely friendly way. Niamh was serving us too and was also friendly and efficient.  Nothing was too much trouble and they catered to my allergy with care and consistency and didn’t make me feel excluded in any way.  Everyone observed the social distancing with the staff encouragement but didn’t make a massive issue of it so we almost felt like it back to old times They ensured the facilities were thoroughly cleaned after each use.  They made the wine was flowing and it was a 5 star experience in all aspects. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Thank you and we will definitely be back soon !
"I ate at Genzo yesterday lunch time the 30th September with three friends.The food was well prepared, and tasted great. The lunchtime offer is a total bargain.Portions were generous,my keftedes were delicious,flavoursome and there were a lot of them.We had a nice bottle of reasonably priced wine, and with coffees and service the bill was around £20 a head. I could have lunch here every day it,s that good.If you live near East Finchley give it a try."
very poor service. The food wasn't cooked appropriately. I asked for pitta bread but never got it. The same waiter than gave me my bill. Terrible service.
Couldn't get to Greece this year so had a weeks holiday at home eating here every night with different groups of friends being well looked after with world famous Greek hospitality and exceptional food cannot recommend Genzo's highly enough. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"Came here for lunch. Hubby had the spanohopita (£3) (feta cheese and spinach filo parcels), and said it was delicious. I had the hummus and warm pita bread (£3) which was nice and very generous portion. Hubby then had the kleftico (oven cooked lamb) (£9.45) which came with roast potatoes. He also ordered a side of feta cheese to crumble over the top (£2.95). He thought this dish in particular was brilliant - the best he’s had in the U.K. I had the stifado (£12.50) (chunks of beef cooked in a rich sauce). I also had the Mykonos Mule cocktail (£7.50) which was large and consisted of vodka, ginger beer, mint and lime and was good. Hubby had a small bottle of Coke Zero (£2.50). Service was good and we enjoyed the Greek music being played. We would definitely visit again."
Don’t usually write reviews but Genzo Greek truly deserves it ! Lovely food and service was on point 👍
The service is excellent and the patrons make you feel very relaxed and comfortable giving you just the right amount of time to choose your food.  The food and wine were also excellent and it's reasonably priced
"Fantastic meal here on Tuesday 25th, first visit here came for my daughters birthday absolutely thoroughly enjoyed the food I had the seafood platter which was gorgeous my daughter had chicken souvlaki and my partner had the mixed grill all were presented beautifully didn’t have room for pudding but will definitely be back we were so impressed from start to finish the waiters on duty were attentive but not pushy just the right balance thanks for a great evening "
"Three of our party ordered the ""Greek Feast"" starters & mains which were excellent and at £22 per person were great value. I ordered a halloumi starter (very good) followed by Moussaka as a main. I have eaten Moussaka in many restaurants but this certainly was the best I've ever had. Really delicious and at only £11.25 a real steal. My wife and I enjoyed a bottle of Cretan red wine which was delicious and brought back memories of of our honeymoon 43 years ago. Our sons had Keo & Mythos beers which they enjoyed. Our first time in this restaurant but certainly not our last."
"Overall we had a good meal. The food was excellent, the staff were extremely friendly and they were quick to offer alternatives for the bread options for gluten intolerance.  Unfortunately the allergen menu was not accurate and the main - although labelled gluten free - had bits of pasta through the rice side dish. Luckily it was noticed and they quickly offered us potato as an alternative. The food was delicious, but I would be wary if you suffer from more serious allergies as the allergy menu in this case was not accurate. The waiter even told us that there was a mistake on the allergy menu but the meal he flagged as inaccurately labelled was different to the one we eventually ordered. Probably wouldn’t go back, but would definitely recommend if your party don’t suffer from allergies."
"Great place, very cozzy and friendly.2 levels restaurant .Totally recommended can wait for reopening."
This is a family owned restaurant that is located in about 5 min away from West Brompton station and you should go ahead and try the food there. The owners and the staff are caring and lovely and you would definitely want to go back there.
"The food here is excellent and the service attentive, courteous and friendly. The dishes are very imaginative and superbly cooked. We particularly liked the fact that the dishes emphasised quality and not quantity - the first time I have comfortably eaten a 3 course dinner in years. We would recommend the Gojk unhesitatingly."
"This restaurant is truly amazing!! You HAVE to order the mushroom risotto with truffle oil!! It is super delicious!!!! The waiters were lovely, friendly, and were more than happy to answer any questions we had! A must go to!"
"Very friendly staff and excellent service. Food was fantastic, the lamb croquettes were a highlight for me but everything was really tasty. Would definitely return."
Don't be put off by the exterior and entrance. This is a warm and comfy restaurant over two floors. We sat downstairs overlooking the balcony. The food and service were both very good.  Definitely would recommend this restaurant.
"I totally understand why this restaurant has such a high rating! The environment is extremely pleasant and the food is just delicious. I had all vegetarian options and they were to die for.. and the winter berry crumble was just amazing. The woman serving us was so kind. She even split gave each of us our individual bills so we didn’t have to calculate them ourselves, something which I had never seen before and was so pleasantly surprised by. Our only disappointment was that many of us couldn’t get our starters and mains of choice because they were out. One of us had to have our fourth choice.. Although I will say that we were a large group of nine for this tiny restaurant and booked the day of, so maybe they simply hadn’t had the time to prepare for it. I highly recommend!"
"We had long intended to try the restaurant, temporarily closed during the Covid crisis, and this week finally ordered for delivery a couple of three course meals and more side dishes than was good for us.  The food arrived on time and exactly as described. Substantial portions and quite delicious. Unfortunately, having raved to friends about the stylish sea bream en papillote, I won’t be able to pass it off as my own work in future! Particular praise for the oriental style veg, but everything I ordered was full of flavour and looked and tasted fresh.  The Clink is a great initiative. Good luck to everyone involved. "
"Each time we've visited this charming little restaurant it has never failed to impress in terms of the quality of the food and the excellent service. The choice of tapas style dishes is very good and cannot recommend highly enough the homemade Muhammara, Greek Davos salad, the delicious Scallop Tartare and the Seabass along with a selection of Tempura dishes. The staff are very friendly and helpful as well as attentive but in a not too intrusive manner. It is slightly off the main road on a residential street but it very much deserves to be visited as you are guaranteed a lovely experience. Looking forward to our next visit."
"Really love this place! My partner and I opted for 3 dishes each which was recommended by staff. All 6 dishes were delicious and beautifully presented, I think we could have had just shared 5 and been full between us however. Liked the chill atmosphere of the place however it did feel a little crowded in there (especially because the party next to us sat next to each other on a table of two as opposed to opposite...), it would've been a better experience with maybe a few less tables. Initial greeting was a little cold and took staff a while to acknowledge us but other than this they were friendly. One thing that I'm not keen on is the automatic addition of the 12.5% service charge which ends up being quite a lot after ordering 6 dishes and 2 drinks. I understand this can be taken off, but this is a little awkward to ask, so would much rather a prompt when paying to enter a tip of our own.  This place is definitely good for a special trip or occasion and would recommend!"
Liman is one of the best turkish restaurant. We love the food and service. Nice menu and food. Lamb sish and halloumi are the best.
Went on a Wednesday evening. Very quiet indeed but food lived up to expectations. Monkfish was excellent with delicious lobster sauce...and we shared a chocolate fondant for dessert which was tasty too...Attentive and friendly service...
"Good food, good service. Quite unattractive exterior, but once inside it’s fine, friendly and comfortable.  We had tiger shrimp (very good, but maybe too spicy to fully appreciate the shrimp), scallops with chorizo (great!), lamb chops (why same spice/sauce as the shrimps? = not a great combination), rump of lamb (very nice), fondant de chocolat (Very big fondant- share!, great with salty caramel ice cream) and pecan tart with vanilla ice cream (great). Nice Malbec by the glass. "
"The Gojk make my Quick London business time  Excellent! Excellent Food, Excellent Service, Excellent Atmosphere! Scallops to die for, best ever I had ! Will be back!"
"Clean, Amazing service from Christina who gave 100% she was chatty, efficient and an asset to Hard Rock Team. Food very good, better than expected. Open Kitchen was clean and looking fresh. Great meal definitely would return."
"Great food and atmosphere...exactly what you would expect. Useless checking in system...3 staff hanging around and computer says no. Whole experience was made by brilliant waitress Christina...really knew her stuff...very efficient, non-intrusive but but chatty and much fun!!"
Ordered our meals and had them delivered ready to warm when we were ready. Worked really well and delicious food.
Fabulous restaurant serving excellent food and drink with fabulous service. Great value.  Will be returning.
We were here from the states visiting family. They brought us to the Clink. The atmosphere is wonderful. Our waiter was absolutely amazing. Lenroy was very attentive to our needs. The food was gorgeously presented and delicious. As we left we had a wonderful chat with the staff all very nice. Definitely recommend the Clink as a must place to go of visiting the area.
"Just been for lunch with my hubbie. The whole experience from checking in to entering the Prison was very good. Quite scary being locked in making you realise a little of prison life. The food was delicious, duck & soup to start. Pork for mains and deserts and coffee were fantastic. Our server Nevin was very smiley, polite and great. He was passionate of this job. We wish him good luck for the future x I would definitely recommend Clink Brixton xx"
"Had Sunday lunch here today and can't speak highly enough of the food, the service and particularly the concept. The entrance through security, leaving our belongings in lockers, huge security gates clanging behind us and being frisked, was a sobering start. But the very warm welcome once we were inside the restaurant was lovely. Three course Sunday lunch was beautifully cooked and we were served with great attention by Lu. The Clink is an amazing charity and I'd certainly go again - very best wishes to all involved. PS Don't forget your photo ID!"
The food was absolutely lovely - beautifully cooked and presented.... staff were charming and so aiming to please...
"We have had afternoon at the ritz, orsett hall, mad dogs and map maison afternoon tea with unlimited gin easily exceeds them all. Great selection of food, fantastic choice of drinks and all delivered with super friendly and excellent service from Thomas. Thank you we will be booking again."
