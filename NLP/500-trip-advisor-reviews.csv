"I was away for couple of months and I am so happy to be back for my regular cocotte meal, after collecting from the restaurant everything was as great and perfect than eating in. Juicy chicken, fresh side, amazing mash potato.What a great dinner at home again thanks to COCOTTE."
"I recently ordered over the phone from Cocotte to collect for a gathering at home. On calling the restaurant for the delivery, the service was polite, well communicated and friendly. The person on the phone had a great knowledge of the menu and gave helpful suggestions for customer favourites. The food was ready to collect swiftly at the time we requested and was well packaged for the journey home. The food itself traveled well which is fantastic, the food remained warm and as tasty as when we've eaten on site. All in all what a fabulous night made perfect by Cocottes tasty food and efficient service."
"Came here because we missed our table at Farmacy across the road. The waitress accommodated us within 10 minutes and offered suitable vegan food. No lager on tap but not the end of the world. Enjoyed everything. 2 people, 4 dishes, 2 cocktails and 2 beers came to £62 which seemed reasonable for this area in London. Would certainly come back for a snack."
"My first time in cocotte and was amazed by how friendly this member of front of house staff Julia was. From I entered, during our meal and until we left. My partner was left delighted at how attentive she was and we will definitely come back again"

Great food and quality of the products. Its a perfect place to go on a family dinner. Definitely recommend it
My husband and I visited for the first time this month and we had a brilliant experience. First time eating out since lockdown but the procedures the staff had in place made us feel relaxed and welcome.  I loved the truffle croquet and beetroot salad! Would definitely order this again. Great menu selection and staff were attentive.  Thanks for a great experience!
"Visited Cocotte with family in July and it was a very pleasant dining experience. We were seated very quickly as we made a reservation and the waiter took our drinks order as we decided on main dishes to order.  I ordered the Cocotte Ceaser Salad, and it was the best Ceaser Salad I have tasted, the chicken was well seasoned and cooked to perfection. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. "
"We had a fantastic meal at cocotte with friends - our first meal in a restaurant since lockdown - and it couldn’t have been better. Our waitress Valentina created the most relaxing environment, she went above and beyond and provided us with the best service (I’ve eaten at a lot of places varying from 3 Michelin stars and Valentina is probably one of the best waitresses I’ve ever seen!!). Her hosting skills really made us forget the pandemic. The food was fantastic. I highly recommend the truffle mac & cheese and the foie gras croquette (I don’t usually like foie gras!).  Excellent all around, brilliant quality, good value for money but most of all faultless service - thank you to team Cocotte! "
"If you really liked the chicken you really need to go. They have amazing, side and the best cocktails very friendly, staff thank you!!"
"We thoroughly enjoyed our time on The Prince Regent.  Food was very good and included great attention to food intolerances.  Service was excellent - knowledgable, informative, friendly, and entertaining! Very rare do I think gratuity is so deserved.  Really nice aperitif.  Wine was an interesting but good selection.  A great way to see the views from the canal boat.  Any other points... we’d prefer not to use the very same cutlery for all four savoury courses, even if they could be changed just once would be nicer, and we appreciate washing up on a boat isn’t easy.  And the drinks are a bit expensive.  But overall, recommend. "
"Myself and hubby were bought a voucher for this cruise. We used it on Saturday. What can I say except it is wonderful! Our host Steph was very professional, funny and charming. She was very professional explaining everything about the cruise and Covid rules. We went for the wine pairing with the dishes at £55 a head was great to do but next time we’ll order by bottle. We didn’t like one of the wines and Ollie our wine waiter exchanged it and gave us something different... The food is a 5 course set menu with no alternatives. The first 2 courses bear in mind are sharing courses. Then you get your own course 3, 4 then own dessert. Luckily all the courses were delicious and we enjoyed each and everyone. The sail is really nice and we had perfect weather. They have 2 toilets onboard. This was my only gripe... it’s not easy to see how to flush, I only found out as someone asked whilst I was in one and I heard, every time I went the toilet the loo was not flushed!! Not great to see. Definitely think in the briefing they give us all at the beginning they need to tell people we’re the flush is!  This isn’t a cheap meal but we still loved it and definitely will do it again!  Absolutely recommend "
"The crew on the boat were very welcoming and created a relaxed and informal atmosphere, and were very friendly. My wife was on crutches after breaking her ankle, but they helped her on and off the boat with care and consideration. The food was amazing, so tasty and perfectly cooked. The boat lazily cruised along the canal, and the scenery of big houses and other boats was interesting too. It felt very peaceful and relaxing in the heart of London. The wines were brilliant, and the wine waiter knew his wines well. Altogether an experience we can't wait to repeat. I thoroughly recommend it."
"One of the best restaurant in Heart of London . Nice restaurant, delicious food, stuff are very friendly, I’m definitely coming back."
"We had lunch onboard the Prince Regent this afternoon and the whole experience was wonderful. We couldn’t fault the service or the food. The attention to detail on the service was second to none, one of hosts noticed at the beginning that I hadn’t drunk my aperitif and brought me over a delicious non- alcoholic alternative of sparkling tea instead (which was excellent) My personal highlight of the tasting menu was the Cornish crab & peach gazpacho. A great alternative lunch treat in London!"
"We ordered 2 set of meze - £22 per person. The food wasn’t disappointing but definitely the portion size. Been to many Greek restaurants for meze and paying the same price but I have never seen such small selection and potion sizes. I thought it was a joke and asked the waiter and he was rather rude. If you would like to go somewhere to have a weight watcher’s birthday celebration, this is the place.  Food is good but value for money is extremely poor! No doubt to say, in any hurry to come back."
We boarded the Prince Regent last Sunday for their lunchtime cruise and was greeted by Leah who gave us a welcome glass of Somerset cider brandy with sour dough bread and anchovy butter mousse - a perfect appetizer. You can wander outside at the front of the barge between courses to look at the big houses and houseboats but then we were back inside for the first course of fish and chips (the best batter I have ever tasted ) with a chilled glass of Semillon. The next course of Cured Char (a first) with pickles preceded the wonderful combination of cornish crab with peach gazpacho and then the main dish of Hake cooked to perfection. We drank Rose Txakoli from the Basque region of Spain. The desert of Ricotta cheesecake with macerated Madeira strawberries rounded off a wonderful afternoon which was a really lovely experience. The service from Leah and Niamh was first class as was Stuart's cooking. The Captain steered the boat brilliantly through the narrow tunnels. We will now try The Grand Duchess static barge restaurant.
"This was such a fabulous experience from start to finish. The Prince Regent is a lovely barge, and has been arranged to enable everyone to feel very comfortable and safe. The 5 course set lunch was absolutely delicious, best food we’ve eaten for a long time. I tried several different glasses of wine, including one made in Bethnal Green! All were very good! The service is excellent, and you are made to feel very welcome. The views are really interesting, going through Little Venice, past London Zoo, then turning at Camden Lock and returning back the same way. I really can’t wait to return. They are very easy to find, just take the Sheldon Square exit from Paddington Station, and the Prince Regent is a two minute walk along the canal. Thank you for making my birthday special."
This was a first choice of a ladies lunch after 4 months of lockdown. It did not disappoint.  We had to pay in advance which I was fine with as in these times the restaurants are in survival mode.  Harry greeted us in a warm and extremely friendly way. Niamh was serving us too and was also friendly and efficient.  Nothing was too much trouble and they catered to my allergy with care and consistency and didn’t make me feel excluded in any way.  Everyone observed the social distancing with the staff encouragement but didn’t make a massive issue of it so we almost felt like it back to old times They ensured the facilities were thoroughly cleaned after each use.  They made the wine was flowing and it was a 5 star experience in all aspects. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Thank you and we will definitely be back soon !
"I ate at Genzo yesterday lunch time the 30th September with three friends.The food was well prepared, and tasted great. The lunchtime offer is a total bargain.Portions were generous,my keftedes were delicious,flavoursome and there were a lot of them.We had a nice bottle of reasonably priced wine, and with coffees and service the bill was around £20 a head. I could have lunch here every day it,s that good.If you live near East Finchley give it a try."
very poor service. The food wasn't cooked appropriately. I asked for pitta bread but never got it. The same waiter than gave me my bill. Terrible service.
Couldn't get to Greece this year so had a weeks holiday at home eating here every night with different groups of friends being well looked after with world famous Greek hospitality and exceptional food cannot recommend Genzo's highly enough. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"Came here for lunch. Hubby had the spanohopita (£3) (feta cheese and spinach filo parcels), and said it was delicious. I had the hummus and warm pita bread (£3) which was nice and very generous portion. Hubby then had the kleftico (oven cooked lamb) (£9.45) which came with roast potatoes. He also ordered a side of feta cheese to crumble over the top (£2.95). He thought this dish in particular was brilliant - the best he’s had in the U.K. I had the stifado (£12.50) (chunks of beef cooked in a rich sauce). I also had the Mykonos Mule cocktail (£7.50) which was large and consisted of vodka, ginger beer, mint and lime and was good. Hubby had a small bottle of Coke Zero (£2.50). Service was good and we enjoyed the Greek music being played. We would definitely visit again."
Don’t usually write reviews but Genzo Greek truly deserves it ! Lovely food and service was on point 👍
The service is excellent and the patrons make you feel very relaxed and comfortable giving you just the right amount of time to choose your food.  The food and wine were also excellent and it's reasonably priced
"Fantastic meal here on Tuesday 25th, first visit here came for my daughters birthday absolutely thoroughly enjoyed the food I had the seafood platter which was gorgeous my daughter had chicken souvlaki and my partner had the mixed grill all were presented beautifully didn’t have room for pudding but will definitely be back we were so impressed from start to finish the waiters on duty were attentive but not pushy just the right balance thanks for a great evening "
"Three of our party ordered the ""Greek Feast"" starters & mains which were excellent and at £22 per person were great value. I ordered a halloumi starter (very good) followed by Moussaka as a main. I have eaten Moussaka in many restaurants but this certainly was the best I've ever had. Really delicious and at only £11.25 a real steal. My wife and I enjoyed a bottle of Cretan red wine which was delicious and brought back memories of of our honeymoon 43 years ago. Our sons had Keo & Mythos beers which they enjoyed. Our first time in this restaurant but certainly not our last."
"Overall we had a good meal. The food was excellent, the staff were extremely friendly and they were quick to offer alternatives for the bread options for gluten intolerance.  Unfortunately the allergen menu was not accurate and the main - although labelled gluten free - had bits of pasta through the rice side dish. Luckily it was noticed and they quickly offered us potato as an alternative. The food was delicious, but I would be wary if you suffer from more serious allergies as the allergy menu in this case was not accurate. The waiter even told us that there was a mistake on the allergy menu but the meal he flagged as inaccurately labelled was different to the one we eventually ordered. Probably wouldn’t go back, but would definitely recommend if your party don’t suffer from allergies."
"Great place, very cozzy and friendly.2 levels restaurant .Totally recommended can wait for reopening."
This is a family owned restaurant that is located in about 5 min away from West Brompton station and you should go ahead and try the food there. The owners and the staff are caring and lovely and you would definitely want to go back there.
"The food here is excellent and the service attentive, courteous and friendly. The dishes are very imaginative and superbly cooked. We particularly liked the fact that the dishes emphasised quality and not quantity - the first time I have comfortably eaten a 3 course dinner in years. We would recommend the Gojk unhesitatingly."
"This restaurant is truly amazing!! You HAVE to order the mushroom risotto with truffle oil!! It is super delicious!!!! The waiters were lovely, friendly, and were more than happy to answer any questions we had! A must go to!"
"Very friendly staff and excellent service. Food was fantastic, the lamb croquettes were a highlight for me but everything was really tasty. Would definitely return."
Don't be put off by the exterior and entrance. This is a warm and comfy restaurant over two floors. We sat downstairs overlooking the balcony. The food and service were both very good.  Definitely would recommend this restaurant.
"I totally understand why this restaurant has such a high rating! The environment is extremely pleasant and the food is just delicious. I had all vegetarian options and they were to die for.. and the winter berry crumble was just amazing. The woman serving us was so kind. She even split gave each of us our individual bills so we didn’t have to calculate them ourselves, something which I had never seen before and was so pleasantly surprised by. Our only disappointment was that many of us couldn’t get our starters and mains of choice because they were out. One of us had to have our fourth choice.. Although I will say that we were a large group of nine for this tiny restaurant and booked the day of, so maybe they simply hadn’t had the time to prepare for it. I highly recommend!"
"We had long intended to try the restaurant, temporarily closed during the Covid crisis, and this week finally ordered for delivery a couple of three course meals and more side dishes than was good for us.  The food arrived on time and exactly as described. Substantial portions and quite delicious. Unfortunately, having raved to friends about the stylish sea bream en papillote, I won’t be able to pass it off as my own work in future! Particular praise for the oriental style veg, but everything I ordered was full of flavour and looked and tasted fresh.  The Clink is a great initiative. Good luck to everyone involved. "
"Each time we've visited this charming little restaurant it has never failed to impress in terms of the quality of the food and the excellent service. The choice of tapas style dishes is very good and cannot recommend highly enough the homemade Muhammara, Greek Davos salad, the delicious Scallop Tartare and the Seabass along with a selection of Tempura dishes. The staff are very friendly and helpful as well as attentive but in a not too intrusive manner. It is slightly off the main road on a residential street but it very much deserves to be visited as you are guaranteed a lovely experience. Looking forward to our next visit."
"Really love this place! My partner and I opted for 3 dishes each which was recommended by staff. All 6 dishes were delicious and beautifully presented, I think we could have had just shared 5 and been full between us however. Liked the chill atmosphere of the place however it did feel a little crowded in there (especially because the party next to us sat next to each other on a table of two as opposed to opposite...), it would've been a better experience with maybe a few less tables. Initial greeting was a little cold and took staff a while to acknowledge us but other than this they were friendly. One thing that I'm not keen on is the automatic addition of the 12.5% service charge which ends up being quite a lot after ordering 6 dishes and 2 drinks. I understand this can be taken off, but this is a little awkward to ask, so would much rather a prompt when paying to enter a tip of our own.  This place is definitely good for a special trip or occasion and would recommend!"
Liman is one of the best turkish restaurant. We love the food and service. Nice menu and food. Lamb sish and halloumi are the best.
Went on a Wednesday evening. Very quiet indeed but food lived up to expectations. Monkfish was excellent with delicious lobster sauce...and we shared a chocolate fondant for dessert which was tasty too...Attentive and friendly service...
"Good food, good service. Quite unattractive exterior, but once inside it’s fine, friendly and comfortable.  We had tiger shrimp (very good, but maybe too spicy to fully appreciate the shrimp), scallops with chorizo (great!), lamb chops (why same spice/sauce as the shrimps? = not a great combination), rump of lamb (very nice), fondant de chocolat (Very big fondant- share!, great with salty caramel ice cream) and pecan tart with vanilla ice cream (great). Nice Malbec by the glass. "
"The Gojk make my Quick London business time  Excellent! Excellent Food, Excellent Service, Excellent Atmosphere! Scallops to die for, best ever I had ! Will be back!"
"Clean, Amazing service from Christina who gave 100% she was chatty, efficient and an asset to Hard Rock Team. Food very good, better than expected. Open Kitchen was clean and looking fresh. Great meal definitely would return."
"Great food and atmosphere...exactly what you would expect. Useless checking in system...3 staff hanging around and computer says no. Whole experience was made by brilliant waitress Christina...really knew her stuff...very efficient, non-intrusive but but chatty and much fun!!"
Ordered our meals and had them delivered ready to warm when we were ready. Worked really well and delicious food.
Fabulous restaurant serving excellent food and drink with fabulous service. Great value.  Will be returning.
We were here from the states visiting family. They brought us to the Clink. The atmosphere is wonderful. Our waiter was absolutely amazing. Lenroy was very attentive to our needs. The food was gorgeously presented and delicious. As we left we had a wonderful chat with the staff all very nice. Definitely recommend the Clink as a must place to go of visiting the area.
"Just been for lunch with my hubbie. The whole experience from checking in to entering the Prison was very good. Quite scary being locked in making you realise a little of prison life. The food was delicious, duck & soup to start. Pork for mains and deserts and coffee were fantastic. Our server Nevin was very smiley, polite and great. He was passionate of this job. We wish him good luck for the future x I would definitely recommend Clink Brixton xx"
"Had Sunday lunch here today and can't speak highly enough of the food, the service and particularly the concept. The entrance through security, leaving our belongings in lockers, huge security gates clanging behind us and being frisked, was a sobering start. But the very warm welcome once we were inside the restaurant was lovely. Three course Sunday lunch was beautifully cooked and we were served with great attention by Lu. The Clink is an amazing charity and I'd certainly go again - very best wishes to all involved. PS Don't forget your photo ID!"
The food was absolutely lovely - beautifully cooked and presented.... staff were charming and so aiming to please...
"We have had afternoon at the ritz, orsett hall, mad dogs and map maison afternoon tea with unlimited gin easily exceeds them all. Great selection of food, fantastic choice of drinks and all delivered with super friendly and excellent service from Thomas. Thank you we will be booking again."
"Wild Thyme is a real hidden gem in London. The service and atmosphere are both great, the dinner setting is romantic, the breakfast/lunch is delicious and all is very reasonably priced. Highly recommend- a treat in Shepherd’s Bush!"
"We had a fantastic tapas dinner with some absolutely delicious happy hour cocktails - great value, service and atmosphere!"
Amazing brunches that are extremely appetizing but the main star for this little café is their dinner service (Thursday to Sat) - inventive and incredible 'tapas' style plates that regularly get updated!
"Wild Thyme is an excellent cafe and restaurant The brunch is great, and the dinner menu is original and tasty"
"A hidden gem in Shepherd’s Bush. I’ve lived here for a couple of years and saw a sign the other day. I looked on here and saw the sea of 5 star reviews and was slightly sceptical, I’ll be honest. I went for brunch with my girlfriend on a Sunday morning and it was honestly one of the nicest brunches I’ve had. It’s a small, very cosy eating area with really nice outside space. Service is excellent, friendly and attentive. The coffee is delicious and the food was so tasty! I had the vegetarian breakfast which was delicious. It was just a genuinely friendly, delicious enjoyable, 5 star experience in every way. If you are in the area, there’s no where better in my opinion. Have just booked in to try dinner next pay day!"
"This cafe is the best kept local secret! Complete with a beautiful garden, lovely customer service as well as delicious and different food I couldn’t have asked for more. A fabulous brunch and dinner spot - thank you wild thyme!"
"Amazing pizzas for such a good price with great staff!! Saxo was super nice, very welcoming and made the best pizzas"
"Very good prices , extremely friendly stuff , looking forward to trying some of their other pizzas !"
I visited with my fiancée and we both loved it. The pizza was delicious and warm. We both loved the drinks and ice cream too!
Pizza union hoxton was one of the best branches! Would highly recommend and would definitely go again.
"Nice place, with friendly staff and delicious food. Was looking for a fair priced food and found this gem! Now, it’s going to be a must stop every trip to London and will strongly recommend to my friends. Keep the good work, guys, we need more places like this. P.s: Try the Chicken BBQ pizza and the Frozen Raspberry Mojito!"
Been here today and it was amazing!best pizza in town!Calabria is the best especially if you prefer spicy!
"Food was ok, service was a bit cold and careless. Quite noisy - we might be a bit too  old or oldfashioned for this place. The younger clientele seemed to like the place."
Great food and even better service. Angela was the best waitress/server I've ever had. Promote this woman!
"I’m a big foodie and love all of the Asian fusion restaurants including Zuma, Roka, Sushi Samba etc. The food at Mber is right up the top of this list now.... Truffle Tuna Sashimi  Chicken Satay (best in london)  Panna Cotta with ginger  Washed down with some amazing Negroni’s "
"Exceptional food & drinks, service and setting. Will be coming back for sure. Would give more than 5 stars if possible."
"I cameyou Mber with my friends for my birthday and I could not have gone to a better restaurant. Not only was the food amazing, but the standard of service was possibly the best I have seen in a high end London restaurant. All the staff were friendly, attentive and they went above and beyond to ensure my friends and I had the best night. The cocktails were fabulous and every dish was cooked to perfection. I will be telling everyone to come here! Highly recommend."
"I came here with my fiance for dinner on a Wednesday for the all-you-can-drink champagne and vegetarian shared plate menu. We were a little apprehensive due to the coronavirus issues with eating inside, but the restaurant was ready and welcomed us with hand sanitizer at the hostess stand which was protected behind a plexiglass shield. The tables were separated and the staff wore protective masks at all times which could not have been comfortable. The food was quick and fun, ranging from edamame to quinoa samosas, and our glasses never went empty. My fiance was particularly pleased with the aubergine (which she usually hates) and the peanut butter praline dessert. We stayed a bit later and ordered a few drinks from the bar and they were lovely. The only minor disappointment was the jackfruit massaman curry, which I'm almost hesitant to bring up because it was not a bad dish, just a bit plain. Everything else was so nice that it didn't make a difference, I think our dinner was an excellent value and I will be both returning again and recommending MBER to my friends for a romantic dinner. I would post some pictures but sadly we shoveled the foot into our faces too quickly. 5*"
"Great food, great service as always. Family loved the experience.  Favourites... Halloumi dish Mixed grill ( great portion size, enough to feed two or more)  Seafood linguine Lamb beyti Salmon with mash and spinach We were also given some complimentary Baklava ( light and fluffy with ligthly infused rose water) and I have to say it is one of the best we have tried."
"After a tired day we searched for a restaurant and we found Liman. Very warm welcome.Food is great, we will definitely come back."
"It was a Saturday night , They were very busy as it as a great restaurant ! First of all food was absolutely amazing nothing to say.The service very polite fast and friendly.Everything was superb from beginning to finish. We will come again thanks Liman ❤️"
"Liman would be right at the top of my restaurant recommendations, for couples, friends, solo dining, anything really."
"My partner and I came for dinner - our first meal out in a very long time and we were excited, especially seeing all of the very positive reviews.  The food was great, there is no doubt about it.  However, the service from the lady waitress was abrupt and dismissive from start to finish and we actually felt rather uncomfortable around her. There was an issue around my main (the “bed of toasted bread” was just actually a handful of croutons). Her response to me asking about the bread, and if it is actually croutons then perhaps I could have some on the side instead - it was not at all accommodating, and I felt like I had been told off and then begrudgingly appeased.  There was a long wait between our starters and mains, and my parter’s main came without the pitta he had asked for. The kitchen was busy and these things happen - and I think in this environment especially, it’s important to be accommodating as a customer too. The gentleman waiter brought us some baklava later, as he had noticed - which was a nice gesture from him.  However, the service from the lady waitress did spoil the evening for us and is something that is difficult to accommodate for - a friendly and personable demeanour to your customers should be very simple. We heard the tables around us saying similar things. The experience last night does not seem in keeping with the general experience people have at this restaurant - a real shame. "
Quite possibly the best mix grill I've ever had.And the service was excellent.5 stars 🌟 🌟 🌟  🌟 🌟
Excellent food and even better service from the lovely Christina. Nothing too much trouble and she seemed to appear just as we needed her. The call server button in our booth was left redundant! A refreshing change from some of the bad service we’ve had elsewhere on our short trip. We’ll be straight back to Hard Rock Piccadilly on our next London visit.
"We have just had a lovely meal at the Hard Rock Cafe. Our waitress, Christina was absolutely brilliant. She was really helpful and could not do enough for us. She made our girls feel really special so thank you."
"My friends and I booked a table at Hard Rock for dinner and Happy Hour and we weren’t disappointed. The customer service we received was amazing. We were first served by Mack who was covering another server’s break and then we had Bruno. Both were friendly, attentive and held great conversations. They were fantastic servers and I highly recommend anyone to ask to be served by them. We will definitely be back another time."
"What a wonderful evening ! So impressed with this restaurant overall! The food was fantastic, the attention to detail was spot on ! The non alcoholic cocktails were amazing ! Didn’t miss the alcohol at all !the guys were chatty and friendly and happy to talk to us whilst making sure the water and drinks were topped up at all times ...a thoroughly enjoyable evening. We all chose different meals, and of course, tasted each other’s ! The pork belly was tender and cooked to perfection ! The water crust pastry for the venison pie was outstanding, and the fish was soft and beautifully seasoned ! We will definitely be back, good luck to all the guys in there , and thanks for looking after us all so well ! Special thanks to Mohammed and the guys who cooked our food Michael and John ... and the guy who made the mock tails !"
"We came for a mid-week lunch which was very relaxed and with plenty of capacity. We chose 3 courses from the menu and these were skilfully cooked and well-presented. Peter our waiter was charming and helpful in trying to answer our enquiries The ‘mocktails’ were delicious; in particular the J-Sours and if we have the opportunity to visit again, we’ll be trying the berry mocktail recommended by Lu. The whole experience was such fun; it was a highlight in a wet and dreary day. All the security and dress requirements are fully explained during the booking with lockers available for outdoor clothing. The trainees were clearly proud of their achievements and we hope the training will result in job opportunities for them in the future."
Enjoyed a delicious 3 course lunch with friends & wished I'd visited 'The Clink' a long time ago.  Excellent initiative & food & non-alcoholic cocktails were of a very high standard.  Thank you
Its one of the classiest place j have been to in london with an experience as great as a fine dine can be. The food was quite delicious and the cocktails were just on fire. Definitely worth a visit if you have pounds to burn.
Booked the Japanese whisky tasting for husband’s birthday and it was a lot of fun. The host was incredibly knowledgeable and he made the experience very entertaining. There were two cocktails (one of which we made ourselves) and three whiskies to try. The place was also very covid-19 prepared with screens up at the bar between customers.  Afterwards we stayed for tapas & cocktails - delicious.  This is a lovely little bar with a lot of atmosphere. Hope to come back soon to try the bottomless brunch.
"What can we say other than wow! We were looked after from start to finish, great conversation and knowledge. Very friendly. We did the virgin cocktail experience and I just wish we could up route the bar and place it near us!!!!Lee & Claire"
I decided to take my partner for brunch for his birthday and we had a lovely time. I friendly welcome and  quiet yet warm atmosphere. And we really enjoyed the cheese cake!!! And our brunch too of course!!! We will be visiting again! Thank you!!
"Apart of the greate service, after a night out, the food was amazing , just a littel haven .Thanks!!"
"Beautiful cafe, with amazing brunch menu & really lovely outside space. I felt welcomed & safe throughout my visit. The service was fantastic & the food was brilliant. Can’t wait to go back."
Would definitely come again. The food is great and such afforadable prices !!Also the vibes are really good and great location to come with family and friends.
"Came here today to have a quick lunch for my friend's birthday. The place was packed when we entered but the queue moves quickly and seating was surprisingly easy.  Pizza ordered, frozen Margherita in hand and my garlic and spicy dip at the ready. Food was ready fast and tasted great, I went with the Roma and added pepperoni on top.. I'm greedy. Food was fast and tasty, great value for money. Frozen cocktails were also refreshing, think only thing to make them better is the weather.  Saxo one of the servers came round to ask if we wanted more drinks, okay why not, ordered another round of drinks and asked him if I can pay for it as it's my friend's birthday, and not only did he put the orders in and let me pay later, he also threw in a nice dessert pizza. Wasn't expecting that, but made my friend smile! Thanks for the lovely service and meal pizza union hoxton!"
"The food here is just amazing - each dish is packed with flavour and presented immaculately. All of the dishes I had were so flavourful, but I would definitely recommend the Satay Chicken and the Pork Doughnuts! The food was served really quickly and always really hot. The staff were very welcoming and friendly, as well as very professional improving the service during my visit. The food is costly, especially for cocktails which may put some people off from coming, but it is definitely worth it! I would certainly come again, but might have to save up first!"
"Visited here as a couple on a weekend down to London. We pre booked to ensure we got a table. We were welcomed by really professional and well mannered staff. The atmosphere was lovely, and the staff were definitely on the ball. The food was exceptional - the flavours, the smell, the temperature and the presentation was exceptional. I’d really recommend the chicken satay and the pork dumplings - delicious! The food was quite expensive - it was the most expensive meal we’ve ever had - but I’d say it was worth it for such a memorable and enjoyable evening. The white chocolate gyoza was incredible too!!! "
My husband & I have dined in many 5* restaurants in the world but London is our home town. MBER is exceptional from ambience to food and of course customer service. It deserves its rating - superb food & customer service - recommend this 5* establishment.
"Just off Chapel Market, this restaurant serves up gorgeous Turkish dishes packed with flavour. The falafel is some of the best I’ve ever had, the lamb shish is so tender and portions are really generous. The mezze platter on the back is a brilliant option to try loads of dishes, and unless you’re really hungry you won’t need anything else. Would say service is a bit slow but totally expected at the moment. Really recommend. "
Went here last Sunday eve with 3 friends. Warm friendly welcome and atmosphere. Excellent extensive menu. Had the house red very good. All dishes were beautifully presented and generous portions. Highly recommend the house special meat vine leaves! Will be going back.
"Booked for a dinner date last Friday after looking through 10+ restaurants on TripAdvisor and Liman stood out as a lovely small venue. We were running a few minutes late so rang ahead and it was no worries for them, upon arrival we were seated & given a menu with a great selections of food & drink. My date and I shared the halloumi & the hummus starter which were both delicious, nothing like we'd had before and on another level! We both then had a lamb main which we both said was the best Turkish meal we've ever had. We were in quite a rush so had to pay before we had dessert but our waitress brought out a free small dessert for us which was amazing! It was a great evening with fantastic food, great friendly service, and overall an excellent experience. Thoroughly recommend this restauarant"
"great meal, stupendous atmosphere. My wife and I visit cocotte on Friday night we had chicken soup which was really delicious. We also was served by a joyful waiter Ayterio who suggested us the chorizo rice was very tasteful."
"My dining companions and I were happy to find this delicious restaurant near our rental apartments. We didn't have a reservation but were seated at the bar (fine with us)! After just a few minutes though a table opened up and we were seated right away. Friendly and helpful service. The food and cocktails were perfection. It's known for their French rotisserie chicken and farm to table approach. We each had (2)! refreshing drinks...LaVieEnRose (pomegranate liquor, Laurence-Brut, rose wine and fresh mint). oh my! One of the best drinks EVER! I had chicken wings with spicy mayo (finger lickin' good) and the Fernande salad. (barley, pomegranates, feta, spring onions, mesclun salad mix, cashew nuts & taragon dressing. One of the best salads I've even eaten! "
"Chicken was moist and delicious. Veggies and roasted potatoes were just as good. My daughter had the chicken soup which was well stocked and hearty. Atmosphere was very nice. Not sure if they have air conditioning as the door was open (we were sitting by the open kitchen- which was a bit warm). Service was very attentive. Service charge added, also prices for vegetables were stated as 4.5 on menu but charged 6.5. Overall nice experience."
"All in all Cocotte offers a modestly priced decent dining experience. The menu is centered around typical French rotisserie chicken, which can be paired with sides and salads. As a side, the truffle mashed potatoes were excellent. The service was a bit over zealous in trying to clear our plates and different people had to ask for our order several times even though it was not yet busy. "
"We were excited to go and the service was okay. The bald tattooed boss kept touching his face, whipping his eyes and scratching his head it drove us mad just watching him. He then helped the chef!! The chef was working hard to plate up bread boards of vegetables (not a favourite of mine for hygiene old wood just like scratching your head or a dirty knife - yuk) and he worked very hard. Over all I wouldn't go back food was very charcoal in its flavour!"
"Great smallish and cozy restaurant with super food and great wait staff. Specialty is roasted chicken - incredible. Order it by the 1/4, 1/2, or whole chicken. Reasonable price, great food, and very pleasant staff. A hit. Would recommend to all except those looking for a formal dining experience."
"The food was of a good quality, and reasonably priced. We had 2 chickens and a number of sides which was a sensible amount for 4 people. The service was okay, but let down by a lukewarm mash and serving white wine unchilled. That takes the solid 4 star to a 3, warm white wine is unforgivable."
Very disappointed when the delivery arrived today and was missing one of the three meals that was ordered and paid for (a shish wrap). We phoned Eaturkish and they blamed the delivery driver and refused to take responsibility for their error. They have lost a regular local customer. 
New king prawn and monk fish ravioli was excellent. And Nonno Raff (I think) out front was a treat...
"In Cocotte you will basically have the best chicken in London! Highly recommend it.The service is great, very helpful and welcoming."
Heard great things ... ordered take away .. was fantastic ... looking forward to visiting them next week
"I actually don't know where to begin because everything about our dinner here was perfect.  The food is so interesting; their take on 'egg & soldiers' (foie gras in an egg shell) was divine, the souffle has an emoji of the chef on top (niche), the strawberry and sour lime laces at the end of the meal served on a mini clothes horse etc. If it isn't presented in an interesting way, it's displayed beautifully. Also, don't want to give too much away, but just wait until the waiting staff (who are exceptional) come to clear the crumbs away from your table - the method is great and will definitely put a smile on your face. This is so much more than just 'good food'. Unfortunately my photos don't do it justice! I've recently been to the Woodspeen near Newbury and the Latymer at Penny Hill Park, but Launceston Place takes the top spot. It really was one of the best dining experiences I've had in some time and I can't wait to go back."
"Came down to Dalston for a weekend for the first time in years, & headed straight for Numara Bos Cirrik on Kingsland Road on Friday night. Ended up returning for Sunday lunch with the extended family it was so good. Great meze, fresh and tasty salads and delicious lamb chops. With genuinely friendly service. This restaurant was always a favourite and remains a true gem. "
"Lovely free range chicken, great sides, good service and easy walk from Paddington station or short cab ride."
"Had the loveliest experience at Cocotte. The food is absolutely delicious and you can taste the quality and the menu is very well put together with lots of great options. The interior is beautiful, it has a lovely atmosphere and the staff were great. Brilliant dinner and I’m looking forward to returning very soon."
"I was looking for a dinner with my family in the area of Notting Hill. I am a vegetarian, they were not, but everyone thought the cocote was absolutely delicious!!! And not overprice if I may say, we all took 2 things each, plus drinks, and it was less that 30£ each. For a Londonian restaurant of this quality and location, with organic healthy and creative food, it was really not that much... staff are super friendly, Our waiter Giuseppe was always around, talking and answering our questions. It's been a wonderful night!"
"Love this restaurant! Came for family dinner. Small place, but is busy, open table is a nice suggest, love watching the chef at work and food perfectly cooked, the smell is incredible, I had the chicken and fews sides, the mochi (ice cream) is very nice, and a homemade rum I have no words to describe! Good recommend by Giuseppe, he was very kind!"
"Was recommended by a friend, and I must say it was the best Shish Kebab I have ever had to date. 10/10."
One of the best Turkish food I have recently tried in past few years time. The Food are excellent and service quite faster. Suitable for pandemic time by keeping social distance. Looking for to go back soon
"First visit, was very well treated. The food was delicious, well seasoned, and perfectly homemade. Very polite and pleasant people, clean establishment and well organised during the social distance requirements."
"Been around 4 times in the last 2 weeks ,brought my friends and family and been treated very well. Couldn't recommend more"
"Love these guys so much, everything on the menu is amazing! Had fresh bread out the oven last week, which was so tasty. Great takeaway and great hangover cure, thanks so much!"
Having been to Turkey I would certainly agree that these guys offer one of the best Turkish meal experiences in London. Fortunately we live nearby so we get to enjoy their food regularly. Do not hesitate on ordering online but better get there and meet them in person to enjoy their generous hospitality.
"We visited this restaurant on a week night with the kids after seeing reviews. A lovely little place, felt like we were in italy with authentic food made well. We were welcomed by the owner and made to feel at home. The food was great, there aren’t many places like this around, and we will definitely be back. Thank you for having us"
Went to a pub near this restaurant and after walking out of there ( as chef was in the beer garden stroking a cat and feeding it by the kitchen door ) walked into this pleasant Italian .  Had all the necessary COVID-19 precautions in place .  Had a great starter and main meal for two with drinks at a very reasonable price and a very cheerful waiter . Will definitely be going back soon.
"Lovely hosts, food, We have been going for birthday celebrations.Excellent place, extremely friendly restaurant to.eat"
Hands down the best and most authentic Italian ristorante in SE. Was blown away by the service and the food was beyond exquisite. Lemon sole and king prawn homemade ravioli was to die for! Will be back very soon!
"Unassuming & authentically great Italian food combined with a truly warm welcome from Raffaele made for a fantastic evening. The team were really attentive to everyone in the venue which is small & intimate; you can see the passion these guys have for what they do & they do it well! The food was outstanding, possibly the best Italian meal I’ve had outside of Italy. "
"A lovely, family run Italian restaurant.  Very good food, with kindly,  friendly staff and very reasonable prices. Go, you won't regret it."
"Loved this place food is great the chicken is perfectly roasted aparently slow coocked making it so tender and comes with it's delicious sauce. Siders are just perfect for once they are healthy and super tasty. It could be my ""cantine"" for everyday as many healthy and gourmet options are possible. Either for a quick meal after on the way or after a workout session or a long one with friends for some good time around great poultry and siders. You should run and taste it asap!"
"If you're looking for a cool place to eat some proper chicken, you have it.+ their sides are amazing !! quinoa salad or macandcheese, they are all great.Atmosphere and staff are super cool, great for both family and friends"
"I have been looking for a true French chicken place for a long time before I've tried Cocotte. Not only was the chicken amazing, but also the sides (especially the mac and cheese), the salads (try Virginie or Capucine) were great. The whole atmosphere including the service, the large windows and the music, is perfect. Highly recommended for friends or couples. Sad that the place has to close at 12 or 01, coz it could work well as a bar."
"Best chicken i had so far in london ! Cosy place , staff is super nice.Try all the sides they are amazing ;) Perfect location for a diner with friends or a sunday brunch"
"Simple concept, high quality food and great ambiance - this new place is a pearl on Westbourne Grove. The chicken are delicious and the add ons make it even more delicious. I recommend this place for lunch and dinners."
Just popped in ad hoc for a bite and was not disappointed the menu has a good selection of salads and sauces to accompany the herb roasted chicken. They seated me at the bar which really worked I had their equivalent of a Ceaser salad green crisp and crunchy croutons. Then a tasty half a chicken with a side of mash and gravy. The chicken was moist and Was succulent and very tasty the mash smooth and creamy all round excellent had a nice glass or two of red at 12 For half a chicken you can't complain really good food  Loved it and will be back 
We get takeaway probably every week at the moment.  We have tried the local competition and think that Shahi beats the lot.
"I love this restaurant ! We visited it  as a family,  the chicken tikka , chicken biryani and sides were incredible, amazing nigh-out,   the staff were very friendly and helpful . You can park car on the street nearby.Would definitely recommend."
"Just had a lovely takeaway from here. We got two lamb dishes (the lamb was so tender and just fell apart at the touch of a fork), the tilapia fish starter and, among other sides, the BEST naan we’ve had in forever. Just delicious - fresh garlic and cooked to perfection. Only qualm is that the curries were a bit too salty, but that’s not really a deal breaker. Looking forward to my leftovers already. "
"absolutely delicious, we ordered two lamb curries, veg biryani and sides. lamb so perfectly tender. order arrived hot and on time. keep it going guys we really appreciate you serving nice quality food in lockdown."
"very disappointing, all dishes tasted the same.basically of salt with only meat and sauce no veg in the meal at all. also pricey especially for what you get"
"We usually order take away meals due to the current lock down. Food at Shahi Pakhwaan continues to mesmerise our taste buds. The succulency and taste of their Non-vegeterian starters like Zaffrani Chicken Tikka and Lucknow Seekh kebab is mind blowing.Most of their Chicken, Lamb and Seafood dishes are also very tasty and appetising. The Biryanis are outstanding. And the vegeterian side dishes like Baigan ka Salan and Bhindi Kurkuri are awesome and very authentic Hyderabadi-Indian dishes. The owner Shoaib makes sure that he looks after his customer needs and their experience. The menu has reasonable prices. I do strongly recommend for any Indian food lover to try this gem of a restaurant in North London."
My husband + I had a lovely Saturday lunch here.  Fabulous fine dining restaurant with friendly service from all the staff.  Fantastic quirky food that included egg + soldiers - just amazing. Also chips that came in a supermarket trolley + the shoelaces that accompanied our coffee that took me back to my childhood - fabulous.  Completely unpretentious. We had a wonderful afternoon. Looking forward to returning. 
"As a pretty fussy eater I visited the restaurant not really knowing what to expect. Every dish that was brought out to me completely exceeded my expectations and I thoroughly enjoyed. The service also surpassed most, if not all London restaurants I have visited. I will definitely be returning!"
"I visited the restaurant for the first time in early September, a couple of days after it re-opened post lockdown. Food was exceptional, service was amazing, overall experience was second to none."
"My wife and I went with a friend. Our first meal out since having to quarantine after being in France and my wife's first meal inside at a restaurant since March ( my second ). Such a lovely lunch, the food is always great and the staff are delightful. They've taken great care around Covid so it felt very safe as well."
We normally have lunch here a couple of times a year but with lockdown had not visited since January. We were not disappointed. The service and food were amazing and there is still an excellent wine list. Every single thing we ate was beautifully presented and tasted amazing.  The restaurant fully complied with the covid rules but in an unobtrusive way so that you felt totally safe but almost forgot they were operating in very different times. If you are nervous about venturing out this is an example of how well things can be done.
This restaurant is absolutely outstanding! I love Turkish food but the fantastic quality food produced there is amazing! My daughter Irem and I ate there recently we had amazing soups salads pickles and brilliant lamb main and out of this world Cop Sis!!!! We meet the family who own it and their wonderful staff.  Great family atmosphere! I would hestitate to recommend this restaurant and will visit again when I visit my daughter in London. I live near Durham in the North of England otherwise I would definately visit CIRRIK weekly with my friends and family!!!! 5 STARS absolutely!!!!!
"First visit here with the family on 'eat out to help out'scheme during Tuesday evening. I booked online earlier that day & they politely called me to confirm. The restaurant was clean & nicely spaced out, hand sanitiser etc available. Welcoming staff & a nice atmosphere. The food itself was very good, lovely taste & flavors. The onion in pomegranate is out of this world as were the mains & starters. The only thing that made it 4* was one of our starters was forgot & until we said something nobody asked if everything was okay. I do understand they were busy but as a server it is kind of your job to check upon things. Overall a nice experience & we would visit again."
"Cold and hot meze were delicious, I enjoyed the fact it wasn’t the standard meze you normally get. The grilled meats were outstanding particularly the seekh kebab - worth going just to try this"
"We came here during the Eat out to help out promotion and absolutely loved it.  The staff were friendly and service was really quick and the food was amazing. The hot mezze platter was so tasty and the atmosphere was great.  Great value for money, we will be back!"
Such a great place. Simple clean decor. Fresh tasty food all served with a friendly smile. The home made chilli sauce is divine! will be back
Amazing service and delicious food. Will definitely come back! Very clean and the staff are friendly.
"This was my very first time at this restaurant, and my experience was very good. Me and my friend personally liked how positive and interactive Ayterio was with us. Excellent work!"
"To start with, we never got to eat here. So the food might be as fabulous as everyone says, but we will never know.  My wife and I arrived at the restaurant on a Sunday at 2pm. It was busy, but there was a table available. The host asked us if we had a reservation and we did not. He would not give us the open table and offered a seat at the ""bar"" which was right at the entrance. Besides, I am very tall and simply not fit. The host, after talking to a colleague, basically told us that this was all he could offer us.  We stepped outside to figure out our next move. A group of people were about to enter and asked us if there were any seats and we told them only if they have reservations. A woman in the group peered in the window and saw the open table that we had seen. She called the restaurant, on our behalf, and asked when a table would be available for two. They told her five minutes. She made a reservation under Tony. That solidified that the host was, for whatever reason, being selective and quite rude. I still don't understand why.  Additionally, we watched a young couple go in and we overheard the boyfriend say, ""maybe we can sit at the bar."" So it was obvious that they did not have reservations. They walked in and were promptly seated at ""the"" table.  So I did something I normally would not do. I walked back in and informed the host that he was rude and that we would never go back. He just looked at me with a blank stare.  In all my years, I have never been treated so rudely and I am still unsure why."
This is an amazing place for a roast. The food is absolutely exceptional (especially the truffle Mac and cheese) and the atmosphere is really laid back. Ayterio provides an amazing service and we were glad to see him a few times in a row. We love this place a lot and highly recommend it to anyone else.
"Had a great time with friends and enjoyed the food to the max, customer service was perfect due to the waiter called Ayterio. Would definitely recommend and will be visiting back very soon."
"Food was really nice, the chicken and the mac&cheese was delicious. The service provided by catalin was perfect! Thank you."
"Had a very good meal tonight, I had the chicken shish. Quality of the meat and the bread was extremely good, nothing like a normal kebab house and by far the best I’ve had in London. The guy behind the counter gave me some free hummus and bread and it was all very tasty! Will definitely be back and go out of my way to go that way home"
"Always great service, great atmosphere and the best food in London!!! Highly recommended to everyone who loves kababs."
"Beautiful freshly baked bread straight from the heart, and clearly from home, complemented a char grilled chicken Shish to the maximum. The staff are driven and dedicated to being...... as good as it gets! M"
Just popped into Trattoria Raffaele for dinner and it is such a little gem! We had garlic bread with mozzarella and chilli which was delicious. Then my boyfriend had rabbit ragu which was on special and I had lasagna. Everything is homemade and absolutely gorgeous. But the real star here is the service. It’s a family run business and they are all wonderful and really made our evening. We’ll be back! 
"Trattoria Raff is OPEN for business, and we were there on Wednesday. The star of the evening ( apart from the amazing staff who were taking every safety measure, and the table number has been reduced for distancing) was the new starter on the specials board..... crab arancini balls with spicy tomato dip. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"Such a great friendly restaurant to eat which has tasty pizza, fresh pasta and superb specials. Mozzarella dough balls are always amazing."
I live next door and I'm so happy this place opened! very simple & good chicken! great salads & sides! excellent wines!its also pleasant to know you can get a very nice chicken take away if you wanna do diner at home.
Popped in for lunch and I was very impressed.  Had the spicy  chicken with virginie  salad and roasted baby potatoes.Very tasty.  Amazing service They have only been open for 3 weeks at the time of my visit and I am very impressed. Strongly recommend.
"Since lockdown in March we have been self isolating.We have ordered a number of meals from Shai Pakwaan, they have all been without fail excellent."
"AMAZING!!  This might be the best Indian restaurant in the UK. The flavours are complex and balanced & the service impeccable. I’m not sure what was better, the delicious daal makhani, the fish or the lamb curry, or the amazing Peshwari naan... And, it’s quite unexpected because the restaurant is a bit out of the way (although the Highgate station is not far). We arrived following the Tripadvisor and google reviews. There’s nothing to fault really - Shahi Pakwaan is clean, the waiters are very professional, the prices are great... A gem! I highly recommend a visit! And, I will certainly be coming back soon. "
Very good food very good service but only downside table fell sticky that the reason we take one star out. But we will go back to vitsit again.
Had some amazing food here recently in this beautiful place. The drinks were exceptional and the staff were really nice.
Had set lunch this afternoon. Fantastic food and service. Great value. Will hopefully be returning soon.
"Elegantly subdued interior. Truly unique cuisine. Tables situated far enough apart from one another that it feels like a private dining experience. Visiting Launceston Place over Valentine's weekend, they offered a fabulous 8 course tasting menu that was all at once, creatively presented and delicious. Like the toasted bread in a mini grocery cart or the egg shell filled with delectable, creamy morsels. Highest marks go to Tasha, the sommelier, who recommended way to many perfect glasses of wine. The only downside was the meal was definitely richer than what we are used to eating, BUT, it was worth, and we enjoyed, every bite. Perfect for a special occasion or celebration. "
"I have been with a friend in this beautiful and bright restaurant for the first time. As soon as you are in you can notice that the restaurant is a high level, if you have eyes for details. The staff were very polite and careful, the blonde waitress is an encyclopedia of food, they give you instruction and informations of any dish you try, you can see that is a lot of background work in what they do in this beautiful restaurant. The manager always around to see that everything is fine, they have an excellent sommelier which helps you to find the perfect wine match whit your order. I loved the funny idea with the baby vacuum cleaner, and the baby market trolley for the side. I was impressed of the cheese trolley, they have so many kinds of cheeses....and I loveeeee .  I can't understand why they don't have any Michelin yet... they are perfect...and the chef is very passionate and talented young man with an open mind and you can see this through his dishes.  I will definitely be back soon to try new dishes."
"we visited this restaurant as a result of various recommendations, and I am so glad that we did! The food was amazing, and the customer service was 10/10! As soon as you walk in, you are greeted with the warmest family welcome, as its a lovely family run business. The service remained at that high quality through out our whole beautiful experience. we will definitely be visiting more often!"
"WHERE DO I START - Woww what an amazing experience I had at this beautiful restaurant. I normally don't leave reviews but it would be an offense if I did not leave a review for this place.  The food was brilliant and the customer service was impeccable better than any Michelin star restaurant I have ever been to. The restaurant is a family run business and I have never experienced being in a restaurant and the family treating you as part of their family. The chef prepared the food and put his heart and soul into it and the results were phenomenal.  Now that I feel like I'm part of the family I will be visiting this place a lot more often. Once again best service, great food, great atmosphere and lovely people."
"I've been to quite a lot of the Stoke Newington/Hackney Turkish (and Kurdish) restaurants and would like to commend this one. Our food was good - as well as the typical range of okacbasi favourites they also have some great salads. I had a lamb mince skewer and rice, but the preponderance of the meal was plant-based - which is a good option for gut-health. The onion dish with lashings of pomegranate molasses was great. The waiters were nice and didn't constantly up-sell. Enjoyed and would return."
"Great food and service especially Catalin, very helpful and friendly. Also reasonably priced. Mac and cheese was especially good. ThanksThanks"
"I expected juicy moist chicken with a lovely crisp skin but somehow despite the rotisserie the chicken had soggy skin, was under seasoned and wasn’t particularly moist. We had ordered the whole chicken, perhaps the wings etc are better. I was disappointed to be honest however the Mac and cheese is delicious and the sides were too. It’s just a shame the main event was a let down. The cocktails were weak (I haven’t had such a weak aperol spritz in my life!) but the service was attentive and staff were knowledgeable about menu items. Wouldn’t go back in a hurry..."
"We went to Cocotte for brunch on a Sunday morning.  Service by Catalin was fast and efficient. Food was good (ouef parfait with mushrooms and truffle croque monsieur) although on the “heavy” side :) Price was OK (35£ for two mains, 2 juices and one cappuccino)."
"Love it so much the first time had to come back and bring the family along😉! Loved everything (especially the chicken wings😍) and we have to thanks Ayterio, were even impressed by the table service offered to us."
We love Cirrik 19 Numara bos' food. The portions are generous ant the meat and veg coming our from the charcoal grill are delicious. We had a mixed grill as main and mixed mezze and two Lahmacun as starters. It was more than enough for the three of us. The bread is also delicious and the onions amaizing. We definitely recommend it!!
This was the perfect choice for good Turkish food.   Very authentic and unique from other Turkish places I've tried.  The bonus to the amazing food is the great service provided by the family who owns and runs this wonderful establishment.
"Looking for Turkish food, the place to be! Very professional staff, menu very well balanced (Meat, veggies, salads, ...), very tasty, and really affordable....what more? Living in Germany, I’m very used to turkish food and restaurant, but I can hardly remember such a quality at that price. Enjoy!"
I LOVE LOVE LOVE  the taste of everything at cirrik! they have the best prawn dish also very welcoming owners and staff... brilliant kurdish community with full homie welcome and amazingly clean. what a great spot for so many years.... well done cirrik!
We came here very frequently and also recommended our friends to come. The best kebabs ever had. Recommend lamp chops and mixed kebabs.
"Rally nice place, not too expensive,warm and comfortable.  Is a must try the mix grilled meat, well cooked and nice flavour. Well done to the lentis supe, i would made just a bit lighter but it's ok.  Medium rangeFood 7/10 Service  7/10"
Family run place. Delicious food. Down to earth people. A wholesome evening with friends I would definitely recommend and will be back again for sure
"Following a long day at a training course in Hackney my colleague and I decided to go out for a nice meal. Cirrik was close, had great reviews and I can now confirm they’re accurate. When entering the restaurant you’ll immediately notice the present aroma of the BBQ grill. The dining area is simple, clean and cosy. I had the Karisik Kebab which if you like your meat is amazing, everything was perfectly cooked. I particularly enjoyed the lamb chop with a crispy fat edge and tender centre. My colleague had the Chicken Beyti which he loved. Washed down with a Tuborg Gold Turkish Beer, lovely. Service was also great, our waitress was knowledgeable of the menu, very present and helpful. I hope to revisit when I’m next in the area. "
Staying a couple of miles away in Islington and on way back from the city in taxi to my accommodation I asked driver to drop me off somewhere for food. Boy was I not disappointed! This place is a delight! Walk in looks like an ordinary cafe. But don’t let that put you off. Staff were a delight from when I walked in. Red wine choice superb. And food to die for! Had spicy sausage to start and chicken casserole for mains. Asked them to spice it up. Beautiful absolutely beautiful! Will defo go back when I’m working down here.
"Every element of the meal was incredible. Very friendly staff, excellent ingredients and all cooked to perfection. For the area, where the standards are high, they excel above. 10/10 and I can’t wait to go back"
I've been to most (if not all) of the Turkish restaurants in Dalston and Stoke Newington... It's hard to judge which is the very best because the standard is so high generally throughout the area and nearly all represent great value... However this place is a definite contender and a favourite. The meat is so juicy and tender. The decor is very simple but the food is delicious.
"We were at an event at EartH, Hackney, and saw this unassuming restaurant virtually opposite the venue. It did not disappoint. Very attentive and friendly staff, led by the Kepez family, it is a restaurant specialising in the Ocakbasi barbeque style.  Starting with an excellent white wine suggestion, Çankaya 2017 from Anatolia, it just got better. My wife had a delicious Muska Boregi (Feta Cheese Pastry) and salads, and I took the recommended Et Beyti Yogurtlu (Chargrilled Lamb Beyti with Yoghurt Sauce). Beautifully cooked and presented - and large portions at an excellent price. Thoroughly recommended."
"Visited here before a concert at EartH, which is a great addition to the London gig scene by the way! Just wanted a quick meal so went straight to mains and to be honest was pretty glad that I didn't go for anything more, as the portions were substantial and very filling. I went for an Et Beyti (minced lamb flavoured with garlic and herbs), which was cooked to perfection on the charcoal grill. My friend had the Karniyarik (lamb stuffed aubergine) which he said was excellent. Both dishes were served with warm, buttery flatbread, a delicious rice and 3 different salads which whilst all simple, were tasty and perfect accompaniments. The service was unobtrusive but friendly and efficient, so no complaints there. A beer and a diet coke with the food and the bill came in at just over £15 a head, so excellent value. If back this way I would definitely return."
"I have read so many good reviews, that’s why I suggested to my friend to visit this restaurant. I gave 3 stars because of the food, otherwise I would have given just 1. The food was really good, I can’t complain about it but the service not at all! The place wasn’t even busy but they didn’t really seem to take care of us at all. Firstly, I had to wait for my friend who was 20 minutes late. Meantime nobody even came to me to ask if I want to drink something. There wasn’t any check back during the meal, then my empty glass and my empty bottle were there all the time, again nobody even asked a question about more drinks. Then we finished the meal, it took a while for them again to realise it so finally we could ask for the bill. I’m really disappointed because I thought that a family business will show so much care and effort in the service."
"Used to love this place in the early 2000. Went back for the first time last weekend and, to my delight, it's still as good as I remember it. What a joy to dine there! The same family runs it and they had lost none of their magic formula - great food, friendly staff at reasonable price! We had a bottle of Cote-du-Rhone and was pleasantly surprised with how good it was for the price.  The number of Turkish restaurants on Stoke Newington Road have snowballed since 15 years ago but this one is the original and the real the macoy!"
"I’ve tried lots of Turkish restaurants in Dalston and I reckon this could be the best. Food is delicious and fresh - the best falafel around.  The restaurant could be decorated a little more cosily though, and it would be nice if the lighting were dimmed."
"went to LP for dinner fabulous food great cheeses board,nice to see so many great English cheeses.staff knowledge was very good. The only criticism was out table wasnt the best but cest la vie"
"Amazing food, excellent service, fantastic atmosphere! Would definitely come back and bring friends next time !! BRAVO"
"Thoroughly enjoyed every part of our visit! Warm welcome, good service and brilliant food! Recommend the grilled aubergine and the lentil soup!"
"A few friends and I were in the area, and found this place on TripAdvisor. It was close, and we all enjoy Turkish food, so we stopped in, and I’m really glad we did.  The restaurant was super clean, staff was friendly, and it smelled great.  We all ordered or own plates, but each one was fresh and really good. Some of the best hummus & bread I’ve had as well.  Would definitely recommend stopping in here, and I’ll be back again for sure!"
One of the best meal I have ever had in east London.All my family members enjoyed it.The taste of meat was absolutely a delight and service was so friendly.We will definitely be returned.
"I went to this restaurant with a big group of friends and we were all really pleased.  There is an interesting wine list, but the house Turkish one will prove to be a perfect match for every dish and extremely inexpensive.  We got a cold mezze and it was super yummy (especially an aubergine one and a minty one) and we got tons of bread refills. The bread was warm, crispy and buttery. Mains were delicious as well and really filling. Mine was yummy with tender pieces lamb and bread pieces (only note that it has lots of sauce and the bread becomes soggy if you take long to eat it) . Service was superb and even the restaurant is quite small and simple, it's quite pleasant and there's a traditional Turkish oven inside (that will make the place smokey be aware). Food takes a long time so if you have other commitments, let the staff know.   The bill was so reasonable that I couldn't believe we had such an amazing meal and so much wine for that price per person."
"This is class: first class, upper class, top class.  Waiters that serve with flair and fun. Immaculate.  We had a window seat looking out onto a village scene. Cyclists on there way home from work. A mother with children. A car slowly trundling by.  £30 each for a 3 course pre-show (beach boys at the Albert if you're asking) meal of Michelin standards.. But it wasn't so much the 3 courses we ordered (menu does change so I'll not bother to describe ours; other than to say WOW) it was the taster starter surprise (like a mini- garden on the table) then the wonderful bruschetta ... and at the end another surprise, a second delightful delicate pudding ... so more like 6 courses. Lovely (house) wine too. Perfection And the Beach Boys did 3 hours non stop rock .. also a wonderful surprise."
We had lunch here to celebrate my husband’s birthday.  The food was exquisite and beautifully presented and the service was excellent too.  We loved Launceston Place and will be back!
Visited 30th July and settled on the set menu. My son is Vegan and they could not have been more accommodating. This has to be our favorite place to eat in London. The cool elegance and amazing friendly service make this a real gem. Suffice to say the food and drinks were amazing. Not particularly cheap £200 for 3 of us but in my opinion worth every penny. Cant wait to go back.
"I went with my fiancé , who is usually very picky with her food, and Sandro the GM was excellent. He ordered for us a selection of dishes , which absolutely incredible. if you are a foodie , this is the place for you. The culinary experience is amazing, so many combination of flavours and the presentation is second to none. The Chef is very creative and incredibly talented. The service is perfect , they are all on it , very professional and very friendly. The Polish sommelier was great too, he chose the right wine for every dish . Well done to Sandro to you and to your team ,they are really good and very passionate workers."
Fantastic food and even better service.... Great setting and full of normal people... the place not to be seen at. We’ll be going back!!
I went for lunch with two friends and once again had a wonderful time. We had the set lunch and everything was perfect! The food was imaginative with a few little treats and the cheese selection is second to none. The staff are attentive but discreet and they couldn't have done more to ensure we had a great time.  This restaurant really does have the wow factor.
"Having entered this restaurant with dripping umbrellas we were dealt with kindness and sympathy. Our prebooked table was waiting set with elegant style.  The menu was easy to negotiate where we chose the lunch special which offered plenty of choices. Little extras were added as we went along. My favourite dish was the Burnt Leek main and I enjoyed the Burrata entree and a deconstructed Tiramisu for desert. A memorable lunch, unfortunately we are leaving London so navel to return."
?My wife and I went with two friends today for lunch. We had the set lunch and I had steak tartare and quail...such a lovely lunch and the staff are delightful
"I visited here a few years ago and the food was perfectly OK so when I friend suggested we go to celebrate his birthday I was happy to do so. My title relects the fact that this restauarant has really gone 'up market' since I was last here and so it was a very pleasant surprise. The staff are charming and the the food was excellent. I really would encoursge you to save some space for the cheese, you will not be disappointed!!"
I came with couple of friends. The service was very fast and they were lovely. Very relaxing atmosphere also the food is amazing. Very fresh and delicious. I recommend different types of mezes and kebab. Especially Beyti yogurt& Adana Kebab. For salad you should get Ezme. 
"We visit Cirrik a couple of times a year - more if there’s something good on at the Arcola Theatre down the road. Usually we have a mixed meze and a bottle of Turkish red wine for lunch, but today we each had a main course - stuffed aubergine and lamb’s liver kebab. Both were full of flavour and very well seasoned, as were the three onion and mixed salads and the bread which came with them. There’s now a choice of four different reasonably priced Turkish wines in addition to wines from other countries. We hadn’t tried the home-made baklava before, but this was excellent with Turkish coffee. This is a family-run restaurant providing friendly and efficient service and serving really good food at very reasonable prices."
Awesome fine dining lunch experience. Bit pricey but well spent money. The finesse and complexity of the food combined with excellent service created a top experience.
Cuisine of the highest international standard and exemplary service in quiet congenial atmosphere. The taster menu is original and well planned.
"Mr. Kay was very kindfull, and funny. Great service and the food was perfect. We tried new food because Mr. Kay give us good advice :) Bon service, et plaisant :)."
"Came here when in London last weekend and stopping around the corner.  Very impressed with the quality of the food for the price point given the location.  We had the tasting menu and matching wine flight over the course of about 4 hours.  A series of lovely “snacks” to get started and then into the actual menu. There wasn’t a bum note here, everything was superb but special mention goes to the scallop and smoked eel which was exceptional.  The wine flight was as good as I’ve had anywhere, great pairing and a lot of interesting choices of slightly less mainstream varieties and locations.  Service throughout was very good.  We will definitely return in the future. "
"Absolutely delicious and incredible experience!! By far the best restaurant during our week in London and that included top restaurants. The tasting menu and wine pairing was fantastic, presentation exquisite and unique, and service perfect! One of best meals we’ve ever had among top restaurants we’ve eaten in, including some in New York. Pacing was wonderful and not rushed. Just incredible!!!! Don’t miss it!"
The food was amazing. Not only the quality but the presentation and combination of tastes and ingredients. Service was attentive but not intrusive. The whole experience was faultless and a wonderful birthday treat.
"We 4 had a great experience here for lunch, we had the set menu plus some extras all were first class perfectly cooked and presented great with flavour combinations, service was very good and there were some relatively reasonably priced wines which were also excellent. Well worth a visit, such good value for this quality of cooking."
"Very pretty restaurant in lovely area. Nice oddly shaped rooms which created a sense of intimacy. Staff is nice and professional. We had to wait a bit to get their attention on one or two occasions and the 'spacing' between dishes is not always similar. Small stuff, nothing to worry about. Food is very good. Elaborate cooking. One starter ('rouget' I think) was almost so small as to be an amuse. Not extremely subtle either ...but as the French would say 'tres gourmand' instead, so that is nice (even some massive blocks of fried potato, served up in a miniature shopping cart and that tasted like rösti).  Delicious deserts (tiramisu that was unlike a normal tiramisu, but great). All good. We were dining on an evening standard Menu but I think they may have a summer Menu that would be highly similar in (excellent) value."
The starters we nice but the mains (lamb chops and chicken wings) were both over cooked. They didn’t seem to care when my husband commented. £10:50 for a few chicken wings with rice is over priced. 
"My fiancé and I were in London for the weekend and saw what good reviews this place had so took a chance and it honestly surpassed all our expectations.  The restaurant itself is no frills and not much to look at but honestly who cares? Let’s not forget what’s important here; it’s clean and the food is tremendous. It’s clearly a family run business and has a pleasant cosy feel. There were also a lot of local Turkish people in which is always a good sign.  The kitchen is partially open so you can see all your food being prepared fresh which is always nice - does get a bit warm though if you’re sat near the grill end like we were! The food came in good time and the portion sizes were generous and the quality was excellent. Everything was cooked to perfection!  Honestly could not fault the place at all, the service was good, drinks were cheap, food was amazing and it was all really good value for money! Would highly recommend!"
"I was meeting up with a friend for a long over due catch up so I thought it best to ask a few friends, who live in Dalston, their suggestion on a good Turkish restaurant. They all suggest Mangal 1 or 2. So we made our way to Mangal 1. When we got there, had a look at the menu and saw that rice, dips and sauces were an extra cost and not included with the meal, it did put us off slightly as we found it a little expensive for just meat and salad. This was a little strange for us because we've been to a fair few Turkish restaurants and rice and salad is always included with some bread at least! Anyway's we decided to leave as this left a sour taste in our mouths and we weren't prepared to spend that much. I'm very happy we did because only a stones throw away we came across this Gem. We were seated straight away and ordered straight away, this was about 6ish on a Tuesday. Our waitress was very nice I completely forgot her name but it started with an F. The menu had more on there and guess what? The meal came with rice, salad, and 2 sauce type dishes. The food was delish and the bread was hot and seasoned! We were so hungry so we skipped the starters and went straight for the main, I got the mixed kebab and my friend the Chicken Sis. I have no complaints, we were stuff to the brim. 2 meals and 2 drinks costed £29. Bargin I say. Oh and we got a complimentary Trukish tea which was very necessary! I will definitely be back! Thanks guys!"
The food was great. Really tasty and good portions. Staff are relaxed and the atmosphere is lovely. Full of people enjoying themselves over good food. The salads were a nice touch. We had a really good time here!
Excellent.... they do the most fabulous onions in pomegranite and the meat is cooked to perfection
The right place to eat the food you are dreaming for.  The best chicken soup you can find and enjoy but not only! The grilled meat is full of flavour. From the house nice soft grilled bred with olives  and salad. Nice ambience and people.
A real treat. Wonderfully cooked and presented. Both chicken and lamb dishes were very tasty. Well worth travelling for. Thank you. Will be back.
"8 of us went out for an early dinner to Cirrik 19 Numara Bos before a gig at the Rock Steady Club in Dalston. We ordered a variety of dishes, my wife ordered the chicken Beyti and I ordered the lamb Beyti. Our friends ordered a few yogurtulu dishes etc. We also ordered a couple of bottles of Turkish red wine. Our total bill for 8 came up to £194. The grilled meats were very good. It’s lovely to see an authentic Ocakbasi grill in full flight! The staff were lovely and we all loved the food. Highly recommended."
"I have been to many Turkish restaurants in London but in my opinion this is is the best. The food is delicious, the bread that go with the meal is to die for, prices are acceptable and the atmosphere is great. Really recommend the place. I come from NW London all the way here just for this place."
Delicious and friendly family run restaurant - dessert was home made and so so good :) service was quick because we were in a rush too !!! 10/10 will come back
Demolished a fantastic spread of starters and some succulent lamb chops. We were running a little late and the waiting staff helped us out to guage the amount needed and to get it all to us in plenty of time. Would happily go there again when we had time to eat at a more leisurely pace. Top notch.
"Exquisite food and wine, attentive but unobtrusive service. What more could you ask for? My second visit and if anything better than that last one."
"A disapointing lunch at Launceston Place when the food for 2 people at the table of 4 was unfortunately served slightly cold, and the air/con just chilled it further. The waiters did serve a fresh meal to the 2 effected people, but of course this meant that we were no longer eating all together -- not what you expect when you are paying ~ £80/pp (incl drinks) for lunch time. Far too many other restaurants in London to ever consider going back. Disappointing"
"We went for the lunch menu, very good value. Food- Very good quality, tasty food. Cucumber Burrata was the best starter, just incredible- tasted nothing like it before. Just fantastic- superb combination of flavours. Rib eye was great as well. Great tiramisu. They also served fish and vegetables as kids meal, which was fantastic and went down very well.  Service- Excellent, no faults. Very attentive and efficient without being in your face. Friendly.  I would probably go for a 5 course next time instead of 3, as portion size for me personally was just too small, may be they should charge more but improve the size of the main.  I would certainly come back again and recommend it."
"Okay, first things first - you will probably spend a lot of money here. But guess what - you won't begrudge a penny of it.  My wife and I enjoy going to high-end restaurants, but only get the chance once or twice a year. So a lot of thought goes into the destination and on a weekend trip to London there is just soooo much choice. It being our wedding anniversary as well, I wanted it to be a night to remember.  I'm happy to say we chose extremely well! Everything about this place is absolutely spot-on. Other reviews will convey the ambience and decor I'm sure; I'd just like to concentrate on the food and service.  First the service - so very friendly, absolutely no airs and graces, but incredibly professional. We interacted with several staff and they were all first class. The recruitment process and level of training here is clearly working great.  As for the food - this was a rare weekend away and a special occasion so we went for broke, ordering the 9-course tasting menu (inc. cheese course) along with the premium wine pairings. What a journey it was! The food manages to be consistently innovative and inventive while completely lacking pretentiousness. Every course has at least one flavour or ingredient combination you've never thought of before (celeriac and mint? chicken and white chocolate? veal cheek and smoked aubergine?) and the cooking is so precise that discovering these new flavours is a joy, and never smacks of novelty.  The wine pairings added a whole new dimension, and really were expertly matched. A Hugely Riesling with the lobster, and a William Fevre Chablis with the celeriac were particularly inspired, but every pairing was a winner.  The cheese course was varied, interesting and generous - three things that don't necessarily happen with a cheese course whatever the restaurant. At the end of the evening we asked for a copy of the menu and chef Ben Murphy signed this with a happy anniversary message, which was a lovely touch to finish a fantastic evening that will live long in the memory.  There may be a crazy amount of choice on offer in London, but I have doubt we'll be back."
Had a lovely evening at Cirrik and were super impressed by both the food and service.  We had the ezme salad which was excellent and prepared in front of us.  For main I can highly recommend the lamb beyti. We'll definitely be back!
"we chose this based on a Trip Advisor search as we were going to see a play at the Arcola Theatre nearby and we were not disappointing. its a very natural place, not fancy but authentic and clearly family run. the food menu was extensive - we could have had a little more guidance on choosing the food to be fair - and as well as various grilled type meat there were unusual stews and plenty of vegetable dishes for any vegetarians. There were plenty of local Turkish people in their (google tells me London has about 500k people of Turkish origin of which two thirds are Cypriot) and that's always a positive sign."
"Went today with my dad early Father’s Day present, food was amazing as was service, lambs ribs & baby chicken both with rice , salad & grilled onions in pomegranate molasses as free sides were great , also ezme salad was wonderful, very reasonably priced, small restaurant but packs a punch will be back again."
Excellent Food! Great service! Very generous portions. Nice atmosphere - it was a really nice evening. Thank you.
"We've been living in Dalston for several years and of all the Turkish restaurants in the area we keep coming back to this one - great food, reasonably priced! Délicieux!"
This place was awesome. From the food to the staff it was absolutely faultless. The food was hot and come quite quick from placing the order and was perfectly cooked. The waiters were very attentive and most of all the pricing was very reasonable. Will definitely be visiting again! 
"2nd visit to this restaurant in 5 years (we live in Wales) and were not disappointed. Food was excellent, service was great and at a very reasonable price. Would recommend this establishment to anyone who likes authentic Turkish food and you can watch it being cooked on the charcoal grill."
"Cosy and very nice place, excellent service, attentive but unobtrusive. Tried the Tasting Menu, which was indeed excellent."
"the food here is exceptional. everything is very tasty and obviously prepared with great care. the room is lovely, one of the nicest in town, great soft lighting and comfortable chairs. the staff are attentive and we had no less 6 different wait staff serving us last night, when we where there to try the tasting menu along with the tasting wines. the three course meal for 42 pounds is the way to go as the 6 course tasting menu for 55 pounds a person, plus the cheaper of the two offered wine pairing, at 44 pounds per person, was NOT worth the money. the two main complaints are thus. the meal took entirely too long. over 3 hours and 20 minutes is ridiculous. too much dithering with tableware and time between each course. this is understandable when the courses are large and you need time to digest; but herein lies the other complaint. the portions. altogether too small. the first course was one scallop, very very delicious, but one. next came foie gras. it was also heavenly...a carmalized thing the exact size of reese's peanut butter cup. next up was partridge. it was the heftiest portion of anything served and also incredibly delicious. a little fillet, tender and juicy with no bones to fight through, total three bites. then we served another three bite bit of mackrel - which was really only average. we were still very hungry awaiting our main course. my husband chose the venison and got the far bigger portion, while i went with the suckling pig and recieved exactly one small silver of pork. i finished it in two small bites. mind you it was perfect, both dishes were. but the pig was served with a tablespoon of mashed potato and some foam of some kind or another. dessert was good....a chocolate moussey cup. we would have left starving if not for bread, extra cheese course we ordered, pre-dessert, amusebouche (sp?) etc. the wines as expected, went perfectly with everything. the sherry with the partidge was an interesting choice and a lovely reisling with the mackrel was also noteworthy - the english champagne was not so good though."
"Atmosphere Bright interior. Formal, haute cuisine table settings. Service Staff are quite formal, without much friendly chatter. Approachable, but keeps it very professional and formal. All dishes are explained after setting. Water filled up promptly. If needed, crumbs are vacuumed with a miniature Henry vacuum cleaner. Very quirky! Food – Menu The score given is what I subjectively think is objectively done well: the execution of cooking methods, a combination and harmony of complementing or contrasting flavours and textures. There is no bearing of my personal taste preferences for certain flavours or textures. I mention what I do prefer, but to let you know that it may be what you prefer, or not prefer. Starters: Amuse bouche (8) Some small slices of vegetables served in a miniature garden pot, which is filled with a lovage mousse, giving some creaminess to the crisp, sharpness of the vegetables. Also served with a rolled cigar/tuile filled with a mousse/cream of smoked haddock flavour, which was a very interesting flavour combination. Bread (8.5) Served warm, very soft, tender, moist in the middle and crisp on the coating. About the size of a panettoncino, and more of a brioche-esque texture in terms of softness, and the way the bread shreds apart when pulled. Speck of chorizo type cured meat in there, giving it a smoky, spicy kick every now and then, and some meaty flavour. Served with a yogurt butter, which has a tart aftertaste, and a pepper butter, which has a deep, roast flavour, and a bit of sweetness. Red Mullet, saffron, squid ink (8) Red mullet pan-fried very tender and moist, with crisp skin. The flesh is flavoursome, and fresh. Potato is infused with saffron. Squid ink is used to form a jelly of sorts. Served with lobster bisque with a strong flavour. Not sure if the flavours of saffron, lobster bisque, and squid ink flavours complement each other, or play together, though the combination of lobster bisque flavour and saffron is interesting.   Main: Quail, burnt clementine, cocoa (8.5) Very, very moist and tender, with the inner parts of the breast is served rare. The skin on the legs are very crisp, and flesh is very tender and slides off the bone. Served with tiny spots of sweet, thick, clementine sauce/jelly, which contrasts the strong, irony, gamey flavour of the quail. Served with little onions/shallots which are sweet, and gives a bit of crisp to contrast the tenderness of the quail. The onion slices are filled with a sort of sesame mousse, which has that deep, umami flavour of sesame oil, and contrasts well with the cocoa sauce, and clementine. Not sure if it goes well with the quail though. The bitterness of the cocoa sauce is an interesting contrast to the irony flavour of the quail. All mains are served with thin slices of potatoes which are layered together, cut into blocks then deep-fried. Very crisply fried. Flavoursome potato, with a natural sweetness, deep, rich flavour. Served in a miniature shopping cart, with a “generic” french fries fast food serving packet drawing on it.   Dessert: Tiramisu, madeira, coffee (8) Has the components of a tiramisu. A cream mousse with a bit of chewy firmness (maybe gelatine or egg whites are used?) cased in a chocolate shell, and topped with amaretto infused cream. In the middle of the cream mousse is a sponge, to signify the savioardi biscuit; this was a bit dry, which I personally prefer to be very wet and moist. Apricot, meringue, basil (9) An upside-down meringue cup filled with a mousse, shreds of green sponge (financier-esque flavour and texture), with a refreshing citrusy flavour, and strong hints of basil which gives a contrasting, interesting, stimulating deeper flavour to the overall light flavour notes. Topped with an apricot sorbet. The sweetness comes from the meringue and sorbet. Petit fours: marshmallow, pate de fruit, chocolate truffle (9) The marshmallow has flavours of citrus and wasabi, and quite salty which was a very, very interesting, unorthodox flavour combination, which was in good harmony and balance. It also had a sort of jelly at the bottom which gave a tingling sensation in the mouth, similar to when drinking sparkling drinks. Fascinating! Very chewy, somewhere between a “normal” marshmallow and gummy bear texture in terms of chewiness. The de fruit was strawberry flavoured, and very strongly so. Very sweet, as they are. For me too sweet. But it wasn’t that it was sweetness to cover up the lack of strawberry flavour in any way. The chocolate truffle was filled with a passion fruit flavoured, I think, caramel.   Personal thoughts – 8.5/10 It was like going to a restaurant that wanted to make you think, stimulate you, and laugh! With an artist of a chef; lots of colours and different shapes present in each dish, stimulating the visual senses! Very well painted dishes! There’s a lot of attention to detail in presentation throughout, from the menu, to serveware, to the dishes.  I really enjoyed the attempts at combining interesting flavours to traditional. The flavours have modern, interesting, unexpected, untraditional combinations of flavours in abundance. I personally prefer restaurants where the staff engage with you a bit more with a bit more rapport, rather than being distant. No problems with the staff whatsoever though. Recommended if You’re looking for a stimulation of the visual senses, as well as the taste! Somewhere with food that has a lot of interesting flavours added into traditional basis."
"Was invited here by a client, shown to a nice quiet table in the corner.  The soufflé starter and lamb main course were delicious. Excellent wine list too.highly recommended"
"We celebrated our 30st wedding anniversary with a low key luncheon at this beautiful restaurant which I knew from it’s time holding a Michelin star. Now, the setting is subdued elegance, wonderful tones of grey, leather, marvelous art on the walls. Service is just perfect, without fail, friendly and knowledgeable!  The wine selection is outstanding and even the wines by the glass are first class. The food was divine and could hardly be bettered. This chef and his team deserve a Michelin Star right now!"
"Went there with a friend for lunch, it wasnt very busy but service was still a bit slow, the food is very good if you like formal ambiance and classic dishes!"
"Popped in here on the offchance when looking for a quick bite with the family. We were charmed by the atmosphere (old school traditional trat), host (happy to let my mother attempt to converse in extremely rusty Italian) and delicious food (hearty, tasty, good variety, good value). The tortelloni were a highlight. Highly recommended for some straightforward and genuine Italian cuisine."
"Food was great, portion size was spot on and service was impeccable. Highly recommend for anyone in the area or around. "
"Lauceston place is a modern oldschool masterpiece of a restaurant. From the moment you step foot in the building, you will feel it's rich history with food and service since 1978, they have since modernized the interioir with cool white walls and gold accents.  They not only have amazing food, but their rich choice of wine is also extremely impressive. The restaurant is also very clean. I've only been ones but Lauceston place seems like the perfect restaurant in London."
"We visited this restaurant on a rainy saturday evening and had a blast. From service to food; everything was suberb.  On a saturday night, You can only have the tasting menu. They had pork as the main dish, but happily substituted with lamb, even though I did not specify before.  This restaurant does not have a Michellin star, but I have to say their food was much better than the food of a restaurant with a star. Everything was suberb.  Most of the time the french speaking service staff is not very clear, bit their smiles made up for it.  Yes, the portions were somewhat on the small side, but at the end we were full.  Desert was the best I have eaten in a while. "
"Rather a dour room. A pared back aesthetic can be great but here it’s done without style- they need help from a good interior designer. Service is fine but not very ingratiating. The menu is conventional and the execution is good but not great- you can get many of the same dishes in countless London restaurants and have a better experience. Portions are very small. Not a place where you can get away with having 2 courses and then think about pudding, unless you’re fine with leaving a restaurant hungry, and that’s notwithstanding the un-ordered extras you get that are par for the course at places like this. You’d have to go for the full tasting menu to feel satisfied. It’s extremely expensive but unlike other places in a similar price bracket, not worth it and just leaves you feeling fleeced. I haven’t begrudged a single penny I’ve spent at The Ledbury or Claude Bosi at Bibendum for example (and nor have I felt the need to go for their tasting menus to feel as if I’ve actually had dinner as opposed to a succession of canapés), but here I just felt like I’d been ripped off. It was the kind of cynical experience that just put me off fine dining in London."
"and that’s the truth. If I could give it 10 stars I would do!  Eaten at a lot of lovely places, Benares, Gidleigh Park, Lympstone Manor, Hand of Flowers, plenty of great restaurants with huge reputations. This place beat them all. How it hasn’t got a Michelin Star or two, I don’t know. Outstanding Food Presentation. Fantastic Flavours. Exemplary Service. This place had it all.  Go, Go, Go, before you won’t be able to get a table!  See photos. "
Came to Launceston Place for a special occasion with my partner. We had an absolutely exquisite evening. The food was incredible and the service was great. Overall a perfect place to go to experience something special.
"Was in London for a few days and the hotel recommended here for dinner. It did not disappoint. The food was amazing, the atmosphere was lovely. Will definitely visit again when in London. "
"My wife and I had a delicious dinner at this fine restaurant. Everything...the food, service and atmosphere...was excellent. Highly recommend."
"Booked for dinner after visit to Royal Opera House. Coolish reception - drinks offered, Fine - I had to ask for a menu! We decided upon the full tasting menu inc a cheese course. Then the evening got much better - great and interesting food presentations - really enjoyed. With regard to the cheese selection - only 1 British cheese!! What about a nice Cheshire or Staffordshire blue or even a British Stilton ? The wine selection was interesting and we loved our German choice. Thank you for a lovely evening"
"What a find! Ben Murphy was on top form! This was our first visit, and we would recommend this to anyone looking for a Michelin quality experience but with amazing quirks in presentation. As it was Saturday, we had the tasing menu, usually not a favourite format of ours, but this was fabulous! Difficult to pick out a standout dish, but the two deserts were inventive and unexpected. The Yuzu with apple and dill was an exceptional experience. We are not ones for photographing dishes, but the Presa Iberica had some supporting elements delivered in tiny supermarket trollies! The restaurant its self is an amazing warren of alcoves, great for couples! Not cheap, but still fabulous value for money considering the quality."
"Best Italian food in London. Excellent value, and Raff is a fantastic host. I go here a lot, and so does everyone in the area! Book ahead on the weekend as it gets very busy."
Ate with friends to celebrate one of them having a new job. Was a great choice for a relaxed evening with great food. The restaurant was busy but service was relaxed and friendly - but not slow. Everyone chose different dishes and all were very pleased with the quality of our meals.
"An excellent restaurant. High quality food, friendly professional service and pleasant decor and surroundings. The £35 Saturday lunch is absurdly good value. I was embarrassed to pay so little for what I ate. The wine selection is original and excellent. If you're looking for a place for lunch prior to the Albert Hall why on earth would you go anywhere else. I'm going back. Soon. "
"We've eaten here at least four times now over the years, and it's always a winner - inventive, excellent dishes with superlative service in a relaxed and stylish setting. This visit was no exception."
I’ve been to Launceston Place many times it’s one of my favorites. Food is always on point and very attentive service!
Just the right amount of formality and fun with inventive food and plating.  Much thought is given to textures and visuals in addition to executing flavorful food.  The service is accommodating with being obsequious. It felt calm but exciting at the same time.
Enjoyed a lovely family meal here. Food was so tasty and plentiful. Good selection on the menu and specials board. Staff were all very friendly and welcoming. Good with children. Lovely touch that they make the kids pizza in the shape of Peter Rabbit which they love. An Italian gem! 
"I can say I was amazed! For a long time I haven’t been so surprised with a restaurant and what a restaurant!!! The food was amazing. Full of flavours and very tasty. Leave aside the food, the place, the ambience, the people were something different, a real trattoria. I will most definitely go back very soon!!!  Thank you very very very much Raffael "
Great restaurant for genuine Italian food. Good selection of dishes including choice of fish and meats. Good selection of wines. Delicious desserts. Very reasonably prices.
"When I went to Trattoria Rafaela one day with my family and I can’t even begin to express the creamy cheese on the pizza and the succulent tomato sauce. The pasta was amazing, so said the kids, and I have never ever tasting such good and tasty garlic bread. I think I will definitely go back there, and that’s why I give it excellent."
"This is a little gem in Sydenham and we 100% recommend this restaurant. I visited this restaurant with my wife and daughter and were absolutely blown away. It really has a homely feel to it as soon as you enter the restaurant, service is really good and they seem to know everyone there as lots of regulars visit there. We had the Arabiata and it was genuinely as nice as what we had in Italy. The food is delicious and on top of that the whole homely atmosphere and good service just completed the amazing experience we had. Really reasonable prices but you do need to book ad it is a small restaurant. We had wine , three courses for under 70 GBP for three of us. 100% worth a visit"
"It’s a joke in culinary terms. Zero understanding of flavour, balance, execution, produce.  We opted for a few courses... a selection of ala carte mainly, the best dish being a main course of cod. The bread was dry, probably frozen. The butter too gimmicky. What’s wrong with a good butter, why flavour it, maybe the bread is so bad, yes it was. The soufflé way way over cooked. A picture of Koffmann on top, why?  Disaster won’t ever return. The reason why it got 2 stars was for the hospitality shown from the front of house. I’d suggest the chef needs to retrain his palate and start to learn what food is, this may come at a later time in his career.  The toilets smell of urine and doesn’t look like they’ve been cleaned, if the lighting was better I’m sure it would reveal something far worse."
"It's near impossible to get decent doner this side of the river. Until this place came along. Spartan but extremely clean, the place has worked out everything to the last detail. Walk in during the evening and it's packed, and with good reason. This is proper Turkish food, from the meat to the seasoning and cooked to perfection.  The doner is a must, especially in the homemade bread. Long thin and delicious strips of tender meat, a good selection of salad and a very good chili sauce. The meat is extremely tasty, the kind you only get around Green Lanes. It has that slightly salty, oily taste that simply makes you want to grab another few pieces and keep the flavours on your tongue as long as possible. The mixed shish is excellent, good as any in Istanbul and with nice large pieces too.  Drawbacks? Aside from the awful chips and the long wait (expect ten to twenty minutes from the sheer backlog) the food is lip-smackingly good and it's long past time South East London got a decent kebab place. With the notable exception of Mr Kebabies run by the irrepressible John at the Standard, there's never been anything nice for Turkish food lovers outside of Haringey. So it's pleasing to see generously portioned and extremely delicious food in a much neglected area. Do be warned that the counter is a free-for-all and until the chaos is sorted someone will try to push past to get their order in. It's understandable though. I hope that they continue to build on what's been a truly fantastic start "
We come here almost every weekend even though we don't live nearby. Definitely worth the effort! Great staff and best quality food!
"My go to!! We absolutely love it, staff are lovely and food is AMAZING!!!! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an authentic Turkish meal with taste!!!"
"It’s a fantastic, real family run business. The food is excellent, we had pizzas and pastas (the cannelloni with crab paste from the specials board was exquisite!). Their chicken liver and grilled sardines were amazing, the tiramisu so so good.  I can’t recommend this place enough. It’s a small and really friendly place where you feel they know you and want the best for you. We absolutely love it and will be coming back often."
This is a great find in the high street. There are even tables (not that many) outside. The specials are very authentic and always worth trying. The regular dishes are also good plus there are some nice wines on the list. Popular so book especially at the weekend.
"Very impressed with this little gem of a restaurant. We both had the specials, I had the crab and crayfish ravioli which was clearly homemade pasta, flavoursome, full of tasty crabmeat and cooked to perfection. My partner had the veal and beef meat balls which fell apart and the spaghetti and sauce was beautiful. Lovely Italian larger too. The only small minor point I would make is that for me the plates were not hot enough resulting in the food going slightly cold quickly, however this is still not enough to effect the star rating of my review because the experience was just lovely!"
"Great evening from start to finish. Raffaele Met is with a big warm welcome whilst they we’re getting our table ready. The place was packed out so booking is essential. The food was great, I had the vongole special and it was extremely good. Very reasonably priced with 3 courses and wine at £40 a head (we were stuffed!). Would highly recommend "
Amazing portions brilliant and welcoming staff with the most delicious food you can try. Worth q visit!
"I have been multiple times since moving to the area, it never fails to disappoint. Excellent food, very friendly staff, highly recommend. Advise booking."
"Quite simply, the food is excellent.The service and atmosphere are just what you want from an enjoyable evening out."
"From the outside this just looks like a very clean kebab shop. But inside the offering are far more than this, which can be enjoyed as a takeaway or in their small seated area. As well as the expected various kebabs, one can try other freshly prepared Turkish food... I have to say what we had far exceeded expectations. tasty food at a very fair price. Happy to recommend - I'm sure we'll return soon"
We’ve just moved into the area and we’re told by our sellers we MUST try the local Turkish takeout .... we had high expectations (from the great recommendation) but wow was our food just incredible tonight!!! Henry & Ami (hopefully I’ve got their names correct -although I’m sure we’ll learn soon!) were super friendly!! Can’t wait for next weeks takeout night already! Happy fri-yay locals :) - Day & Josh
"Fantastic customers service. Staff are very friendly and funny, the food is amazing and authentic,  the most tastiest food I've ever eaten. Definitely have to try this place."
Love love love their bread. The platter is amazing. Very tasty food and very personalised service. We stopped her by chance and ordered one vegetarian and one non vegetarian dish. Both were super delicious. The staff is very warm and friendly. Highly recommended!
"EaTurkish is at the bottom of my road and i've been ordering from here frequently since they first ordered, and never once have we had a bad meal. The staff are lovely, always asking how my family are, and giving me free olives! We're so pleased they've been so successful as they couldn't be a nicer bunch, and it's by far the cleanest and best kebab in the area. The chicken kofte is a particular highlight. Would recommend highly."
"Best kerbab by far ,was just like being back in Turkey 😀staff very friendly will be coming back soon ,"
Our favourite. Lovely staff and food - they’re always a laugh and very generous with portions. Would wholeheartedly recommend
"We were walking buy and thinking of having something to eat. This place just looked to good to skip, gave us too good impressions. just believe the ratings, this is one of the best restaurants in London"
I really love them. Nice and welcoming. The food is brilliant and cheap.Definitely one of my favorite spot
"The food is delicious,the staff are some of the best people I have ever met,the place is always full of happy customers and feels like our local community centre.  Many thanks and love to all at this amazing restaurant 💕🍉🍗🍟🌯🍕"
"Love this place they make their own bread the food is awesome and if you eat in while you wait I They'll give you a little messe. we have had a donner kebab in their bread my god it was unbelievable and the hubby had the special burger, tastyyyyyy"
"Superb food, service and reasonably price. This is a great little Italian restaurant. The atmosphere is cosy. The whole restaurant rings wither the sound of people enjoying themselves. People come from all over the world to this restaurant, it so good that it makes Sydenham high street look good after you have had your meal. "
"OMG, can’t believe this gem of an Italian restaurant has been under my nose all these years and I have only just discovered it! The food is authentic, delicious and truly Italian in every way. I had the most gorgeous antipasto which to be honest was big enough for two; everything on the plate tasted so fresh and the mozzarella just melted in your mouth. My main course consisted of home made tagliatelle cooked with tomato, aubergine and Italian sausage - I can’t put into words how good it was, I didn’t want it to end!  The restaurant is very popular and also a bit on the small side so I highly recommend booking in advance. You really will not be disappointed....."
"If you are thinking of visiting, then I strongly recommend that you do. The food is very tasty and seems authentically Italian. My boyfriend and I are already planning a return visit."
This is the best Italian food I think I have eaten outside of Italy. The service was lovely and the food was so good that we will definitely go back!
"I have walked past this restaurant so many times but never popped in as it looks pretty basic from the outside. Biggest mistake! The food was fantastic, all the ingredients are fresh and in season. The wine was great. Service great. Everything was great! Highly recommend. I'll be back!"
"I have visited Trattoria Raffaele many times over the past year, taking different crowds of friends and family each time. It hasn't disappointed on any occasion and now it's my family and friends favorite local. The food is amazing, so fresh and authentic, the staff are so friendly and accommodating.  Will continue to visit - am very lucky I don't live far. If you haven't visited before, the dough-balls are to die for!! Honestly so so good."
"2nd time I have been here...... both times the experience has been great, both visits everyone in the group have had great food and very well priced, I would recommend you eat here if you love Italian food."
"I have been visiting this restaurant with my family since it opened in 2008. The atmosphere is great, the welcome always warm, the food superb and the service excellent. Raffaele is a delightful host and greets us as friends. Having moved from the area to Devon in 2015 it is great to know that there a warm welcome to be had at the Trattoria whenever we travel to London."
We were a party of 12. This was my first visit to the restaurant and I was not disappointed. The place was busy always a good sign of good food. Fast service for drinks and the meal. There was a good atmosphere in the place. I asked for French fries although they were not on the menu they were served with my lovely steak. Everyone at our table were very satisfied with their meals. Will definitely visit again.
Our third visit in about a year. A warm and friendly greeting started the evening; two of our party chose from the specials board. I can’t resist the meatballs (when they do not include pork) accompanied by a bottle of Montepulciano. Delicious food. Busy and buzzy.
"We visited here after moving to the area last year. It had been recommended and we’re so pleased we went. The owners/staff are incredibly warm and friendly, and the food is incredible. Super quick service, great drinks, amazing food and a wonderful atmosphere."
"Best kebabs in London, worth going out of your way for. Great food, quality meat, fresh cooked bread and friendliest staff. Sets the bar for Turkish takeaways. Eat here more than I should"
"Every time we've been here the food has been absolutely delicious! It's made fresh, and you can taste it. The family running it are so friendly and passionate about the food"
"We made our trip down from Essex and ordered two Lamb Doner meals. The bread was straight from the oven and perfectly cooked. The doner meat was delicious! This came with selection of salad, literally everything was such a high standard of quality I was so impressed and the portion size was very generous. Was a nice touch they gave complimentary cold meze. This was delicious too. Customer service from the staff was exceptional, very friendly and accommodating. Hopefully we can see a chain of EaTurkish allover London."
"Very Nice and delicious homemade food, the bread and meat were very fresh. The boss is friendly and it was a lovely experience eating inside. Definitely we will come again. I would strongly recommend this restaurant for everyone and espritcially for whom is looking for good quality  Halal food as well. 非常满意的一次体验，正宗的土耳其食物，特别新鲜，老板人也是特别好，亲切，适合家人一起来品尝，强烈推荐"
The BEST food & friendliest staff in south London! Everything is so fresh and yummy - fresh bread baked onsite - honestly the best Turkish food I’ve tasted in London. Cannot recommend highly enough! Go! 😃
"very delicious restaurants with very good service! You can find pide, Turkish sausage, doner, kebabs and side dishes. They also do their own desserts. Next time I will try kadayif."
The place is quiet small but the service is AMAZING. Portions are quite big. Very friendly staff. Not much seating space though.
Was told about the place by a friend who doesn't even live in the area and tried it to tonight....best Turkish I've had in a long long time and guess what I do live in the area. Be seeing you soon.
"Tasty food, friendly service. Cozy restaurant, ideal for smaller tables of two or four. Be sure to try their delicious pizzas and the bolognese gnocchi !"
"We live locally and were interested in visiting this place, as it was rated as the best restaurant in London on Tripadvisor. We visited on a hot Friday night. The lack of air conditioning inside was uncomfortable.  The service was very friendly and the food, while enjoyable, was certainly nothing special.  An average Italian restaurant in suburban London."
"Tasty meal (on 25.05.2019), good food service, but... we were undercharged by nearly half the amount, just under £100, of the total bill, we were honest and pointed this out. Very, very disappointed that our honesty was not rewarded with a gesture of good will. Hence my Service rating will be low."
Service was extremely attentive and friendly. Food was out of this world and reasonably priced (dough balls with mozzarella were sensational!). The ambience and feel of the restaurant is cosy and inviting.  Their generoisty and hospitality was enough for us to come back again very soon! 5 stars
"Pleased that I booked in advance as very busy for a Wednesday nightThis was only the second time I had visited this restaurant and was very impressed with food, ambience, and value for moneyWill definately be back"
Great food and service. Unfortunately positioned on a noisy street so sitting outside not without the odd hooting. Inside is warm and authentic and is a great option especially if looking to avoid those awful high street Italian franchises!
"We have been here a few times since moving to the area. The atmosphere is wonderful, so cosy and warm and welcoming. The staff are always so friendly and kind and make it a special experience for everyone. The food is very tasty too!"
"We went to Trattoria Raffaele for the first time a few days ago, even if we knew it since we moved to Sydenham. We are Italians so we tend to avoid Italian restaurants because often they're disappointing. We ordered 3 antipasti:calamari fritti, aubergine rolls and tagliere with salumi and vegetables and all of them (especially the first two ones) were very good.  The best part was to eat the main dishes though. We took 2 portions of pasta with vongole (many vongole and a bit hot) and one of ravioli with monkfish and prawns and they were amazing! Even the dessert was good, a really good (and warm) torta della nonna.  The lady who served us was extremely kind and nice, we really liked her.  I have only two suggestions: - talking about pasta con vongole, I'd specify that is quite hot. For many people could be difficult to be eaten - we found a table outside and was perfect because that day was warm enough in London. Eating inside would be a bit difficult because it was very hot and there was a strong smell of food. We totally recommend it! Approved by Italians!"
"We chose the Trattoria as it was just round the corner from our office for a Christmas meal and we weren’t disappointed. They put in a great spread of mixed staffers and we then got to choose our main courses and dessert. Good service, decent value, definitely worth a go if you’re in the market for up to 40 for a private booking."
"Truly delicious, authentic Italian food, with loads of flavour and a very welcoming atmosphere. Would highly recommend."
"Visited this restaurant while staying with family. Really enjoyed the food, it was super tasty and seemed fairly priced! The restaurant itself was a little cramped but other than that it was good!!"
"This is by far the best Turkish food I had in the last year. The food is the great, very friendly staff and a clean environment."
"5 Stars all round ⭐️ , Very welcoming and friendly staff, excellent value, Fresh quality Ingredients= Meat,Salad,and Bread all lovingly prepared. This was our 1st time Cant believe we haven’t visited previously will definitely be coming back!. I recommend the kebab feast with the home made bread yum! . My next time will definitely be sampling the Pide! Good Turkish food is hard to find in south east london this is one of the best in terms of Value and tasty food 5 ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️"
Good tiny place where you can eat good without expending too much. The service is excellent! The owner even give you some free food so you can taste them
"Blimey... Wish I had known about this place years ago.Incredible food to go. We had Pide, gorgeous humus and a yoghurt drink for a fiver. #allaboutthepides"
Amazing Kebab and hands down the best in London. Service is great and polite and the food is sooo good.
"We stopped here for a quick dinner after a long day travelling. We weren't disappointed.Excellent customer service, great food fresh authentic takeaway. Yum!"
"I've been trying to get a table here on a Saturday night for months and months and have recently enjoyed two wonderful meals later on a Saturday night. The staff are fantastic, welcoming, full of smiles and jokes. Their recommendations on the food are to be followed. The food is fresh, the taste beautiful and the portion sizes truly Italian (HUGE!). The value for money is the best in London. Two starters, Two mains and a bottle of Prosecco (£30 approx) came to around £80. The specials are well worth trying. Eating here is like coming home! My new favourite restaurant."
"Enjoyed excellent Italian food at the Trattoria Raffaele in Sydenham last night. Our party of 4 pre-booked (which would be a good idea) and were given an convenient table on what was the hottest night in London so far in 2019. The air con helped. So did the excellent service, not to mention the very well-cooked dishes which more than met our expectations. Besides the comparatively-small standing menu, the dishes of the day offered us all several very interesting choices. The restaurant also produces fresh pizzas, but our starters and main courses were more imaginative than that. The house red (at £18 the bottle) was not bad too. Trattoria Raffaele comes across as a comfortable, unpretentious but serious restaurant. No hold-ups, no 'not-so-good' dishes, and that on an evening of the Champions League final and very hot weather. I recommend it highly."
"We went last night and the new starter here was incredible “asparagus wrapped in saffron bread and home smoked roast duck breast with soft duck egg in crispy breadcrumbs, drizzled with reduced balsamic, dressed with Parmesan shavings.. This new dish is sure to be a favourite. We both had this and followed it with the stunning crab and cod stuffed ravioli, and seafood lasagne. What a feast. Thank you so much to Raff and all the team. See you again soon. Tim "
"A real gem of a place. Wonderfully traditional decor. The service and food is great. I had the Special- monkfish and prawn ravioli, fresh and full of flavour! So much better than the bland high street chain Italians. Support your local businesses!"
"Wow! Just wow! The food here is so authentic and freshly made. The service is friendly and they really care that you have an enjoyable time. Why go to a chain pizza restaurant when you can have the real thing here? The pizzas, lasagna, sardines, tiramisu were all brilliant. The choice of dishes on the special board was amazing. We will definitely be coming back to try more of the lovely food. Keep up the amazing work."
Genuinely great kebabs always & really different to any others in the area. Authentic tasting with such great variety. These guys are always so busy but they work really fast & really hard to get the food out in great quality. Our fave treat!!
Quality food/Excellent service and family loved it. I will be coming again next week for burgers and grilled wings 😋
The food was extremely tasty and good size portions. would deffinately recomend. Mmmmm there are a couple of tables if you wanted to eat in but its really more for take away. Staff are very friendly. Will order again.
"First of all, I never write reviews, but in this instance, I thought it was absolutely necessary to tell everyone how fantastic my experience was and it was an order for collection!  On arrival they said it would be a couple of minutes, so I waited at the bar where I assume the owner offered me a complimentary glass of red while I waited. He also upon payment rounded down my bill to make it £40 for 2 starters and 2 main courses. In those few minutes - I felt extremely well looked after and once I had tasted the food - it did not disappoint! Absolutely melt in the mouth delicious. I look forward to going back but will definitely want to experience eating in. 5/5 Experience!"
WOW! Its a fantastic place and family run which gives it that little bit of an extra edge. We were greeted on arrival and the owner somehow knew our name. Fromstart to finish we had an amazing time. The food was wonderful. I highly recommend this place. 
"Just returned from this restaurant and despite high hopes we weren’t impressed with the service. I ordered pasta with clams from specials board, which was quite pricey at £16. I often travel to Italy and eat pasta with clams whenever it is available so I didn’t mind the price because I love the dish. Pasta wasn’t like anything I have had before, it tasted very sour and unpleasant. I told the lady who was clearing the table that I didn’t enjoy the dish and why but she didn’t show any interest in my complaint, she simply took my full plate and disappeared without a word. There was no offer to order something else or any other gesture. Its a shame because all other dishes we had, especially pizzas, were really good. We live very close to the restaurant but won’t be returning simply because the service left us feeling unwanted there."
"You can buy a pizza from anywhere nowadays but none will be anywhere near as good as those prepared by Team Rafa, simply perfection, such a warm and friendly place to spend an evening."
Fantastic atmosphere and great home cooked food lovely owners it’s popular so you would be well advised to bookWe love itVicky and James
"This was our first visit and we loved this place! Brilliant service, amazing food and reasonably priced. We will definitely be back soon!!"
"A few minutes walk downhill from Sydenham station, the Raffaele is unassuming with only half a dozen tables but the quality is excellent. It is family run with friendly staff and management. The saltimbocca which I had was superb and the Sicilian red was good as well. Thoroughly recommended."
"The family have now been back to this splendid Italian family restaurant for a fourth successive year for my youngest son's birthday and, as far as I am concerned, we will keep on going. The atmosphere is perfect, not a seat, never mind a table to be found and the food at its usual high standard. The standard menu is always fine but it is the chalkboard that attracts and the scallop and octopus starter could have been served at any of London's finest. The same could be said about my main course, linguine and clams in a spiced sauce.Excellent, of course. The white wine was well chosen and the twins enjoyed the inevitable pizzas. Not only is the food and atmosphere good but so was the bill. Nothing to fear."
Utterly gorgeous food brimming with flavour and authenticity. The service was impeccable and the atmosphere homely and inviting. Will definitely be going again (and again and again)
My husband and I have been going to Raff's for a couple of years now and have never been disappointed. We have also taken quite a few friends along and feedback from them all has been wonderful. Why is it my favourite Italian Restaurant? Quite simply the food is absolutely gorgeous Wonderful ingredients and very well cooked. And of course there's the wine! But most of all the welcome that we receive and service that we get from everyone is great. Welcomed like old friends and Raff always has time for a quick chat even when the restaurant is very busy (which it nearly always is!). Our most recent visit was last week for my birthday and I was presented with a birthday cake made especially for me! Such a thoughtful gesture.
Fantastic local place! Always happy with the food the service and everything else!i'd say one of the best places in the area!
"great food, nice atmosphere, excellent service. lasagne is absolutely incredible. the brandy, less so! will defo be back"
"We had a very lovely meal at Trattoria last night. We ordered 2 pizzas that were just delicious. Fresh ingredients and tasty dough! The desserts deserve a mention too, my tiramisu was just too good! Also, the place is pretty and cosy and staff are really nice and friendly. We will be definitely coming back!"
"Have eaten here several times over recent years. The food is always reliably good, and clearly created here, as this is not part of a chain. At a recent visit, we both enjoyed the Saltimbocca, with its delicious sauce, followed by two delightful puddings. If you have been before, you are likely to be greeted by name. We were even given a bonus limoncello. Sadly, currently not open Mondays or most weekday lunchtimes, otherwise I'd be here more often! Highly recommended."
"Love the home-cooked food in this great local Italian restaurant.  We visit a couple of times each year, often choosing from the specials on offer, always scrummy!  Fab family-friendly place, plenty of choice on the menu to suit everyone.  Highly recommend a visit."
"Have not used this restaurant since it was Montecassino but heard so many good comments from friends that decided to give it a try and happy we did as it was excellent.The service was friendly and efficient and we were made to feel most welcomed as were all the other diners whether they were regulars or newcomers The food was simple but very well done . The Fritto misto especially recommended. As mentioned by Penguino257 the wine list is small but excellent as sometimes too many options can be overwhelming All in all a very good local trattoria which now we have ""refound"" will visit more and more often."
"these guys are always happy and making food with love, which is pretty rare in london. Everything is amazing the bread is just delicious. Absolutely worth every penny and worthy crossing the entire london to eat there!!"
"Love this place, been countless times since it opened and never disappointed - fresh tasty food at a cheap price served with a smile. Highly recommend😊"
"Tried this out for first time after seeing it appear down my road and hearing the good reviews. Delicious kebab, home made bread was nice too. And s good size portion. Really nice friendly service. Hope it stays as it's really nice to have a good local kebab restaurant / takeaway."
"Homemade pittas and fresh pidas. Enjoyed the kebabs, I don't normally go for them but the meat and salad quality seemed good. Friendly staff, had pida for you to try and fresh baklava. Will return, much better than the usual doner places, the staff seem to want to make good quality food. Prices very good too."
"Relaxed and friendly, great specials board and really unpretentious ... It was just what we were looking for for a delicious informal evening."
"Wanted to find somewhere special to go with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary, and settled on Launceston Place, based purely on the reviews on this website, and on Top Table. The restaurant is in a lovely little corner of residential Kensington (W8) which makes it feel like a bit of a 'find', as it is unlikely that you would just stumble across it given that there are no other restaurants nearby. We went for dinner, and chose to have the 3 course menu for £45 each. The food was just fantastic, and with little extra touches as well that I thought were nice, given that we were having a fixed price menu (Amuse Bouche of hand made potato crisps, beautiful just baked loaf of bread with a little pot of fresh pickled mackerel in dill and shallots, and a 'pre dessert' of sweet vanilla cream with a layer of lemon jelly) We had the lobster and venison starters, both very pretty and tasty, and then the lamb and suckling pig main course - everything on the plates was perfectly cooked and presented to a very high standard. Although this restaurant currently holds 3 AA Rosettes, I would be very surprised if it did not find itself with a Michelin star at some point in the near future if it carries on the way it's going! Although, one observation - and something that I was very surprised to find, was that our main course plates were stone cold, which I thought was a bit of an oversight considering the high level of attention to detail in every other aspect of the meal. Dessert was the Tarte Tatin and a Smoked Chocolate fondant with Laphroig flavoured ice cream (If I'm honest - the ice cream was the only duff note for the whole meal - very strong whisky taste, rather than the subtle hint that i was hoping for, which more or less obliterated the flavour of the chocolate fondant and the ice cream itself)  The service was exactly what you would want it to be - 100% attentive, yet unobtrusive at the same time. There was always someone around at just the right time, and we never found ourselves looking at empty plates or with un-filled wine glasses for too long. If I had one regret, it's that I wish I could have budgeted more money to spend on this meal - for me this would be a fine dining special treat place to visit for dinner (Although I will definitely be planning to go for lunch there at some point) and for the above, with a bottle of Chablis and a plate of cheese that we shared, the bill without tip came to £148.00, which was as much as I was prepared to spend. A bit more cash would have made me want to try the specials, which were available with a supplementary charge, and perhaps have ordered a more expensive bottle of wine. Saying that though, I thought that considering the service and the quality of the meal, we got good value for money without question. I would definitely strongly recommend this restaurant as a place to go for a fantastic romantic dinner with great food and service!"
"Love every time we visit ! (usually every week)Pizzas , pastas ,meat dishes all excellent . Great atmosphere for couples and families. Friendly staff and always made welcome! Best place to eat in Sydenham"
"Having just moved to the area, my girlfriend and I thought we would try this lovely little Italian at the end of our road. We were delighted to find that it was a warm, friendly, relaxed dining experience. We both enjoyed delicious pasta dishes, with sides, desserts and drinks for less than £50, and would have been happy to pay more due to the great atmosphere and authentic Italian food. A great restaurant suitable for pretty much any occassion. Would recommend whole-heartedly."
"We had pizza here which was lovely. The house wine is scrummy and reasonably priced. The place is lovely and so is the service, great."
We've been here several times and always enjoyed our food. The calzone pizza is superbly done. Its a small restaurant and has a family run feel. Definitely recommend!
"We have a regular Wednesday night table booked at Raff's, lovely atmosphere and faultless food. Always hard to choose what to have to eat, so much variety and the special are always exceptional and (unlike most restaurants who always hike the prices of specials) very reasonably priced!! We love it there and so do our friends and family, hard to beat for the area..... We had my husband's 60th birthday there last year, took over the entire restaurant and Raff made him the most incredible cake. As for the reviewer who complained about the Toilet Sign, pathetic!!"
"This restaurant is always busy, even on a weekday evening and for good reason. Service is friendly but not over familiar, attentive but not in your face, and you never feel rushed or ignored. You can tell it is a long established family restaurant by the relaxed atmosphere and the way there are always some regulars present, but even as an occasional visitor you are greeted as an old friend. Food is always delicious, and the menu has a good variety of classic Italian dishes, more unusual dishes and there are usually some interesting specials. The wine list is short but every single option is lovely. Every time we visit we always leave wondering why we don't visit more often as we always have an excellent evening."
"I went in for an evening meal with my girlfriend. There aren`t many places in Sydenham to go to for a meal. The restaurant is dimly lit with a nice atmosphere and friendly staff. However, the tablecloths are wipe clean plastic which means they are not laundered, and are sticky. Never seen tablecoths like this in a restaurant before for obvious reasons.  I sat facing the rear, and there is a lit up sign with the word ""Toilet"" on it. Can you believe sitting at a meal seeing this word lit up all night in your line of sight ! never seen that word in a restaurant before. It is a street word.  Food wise, standard food not too good and not too bad. The owner did not see the problem with the word Toilet lit up, and clearly has not been to other restaurants. The place was busy, but as I say, this is Sydenham. Horses for courses."
"As we live just around the corner from this lovely traditional trattoria, my boyfriend and I tend to visit quite frequently, but we would make a special trip back even if we moved away! We are always welcomed by the friendly owners and without a doubt will have a fabulous meal. The garlic mozzarella bread is delicious, and I have never been disappointed by any of the pizzas, pastas or specials I've tried. The food is great value for money - I couldn't ask for anything more!"
"I've been to Rafaele's a number of times, and I love it: great food, wonderful service from Rafaele himself, and  a lovely intimate and friendly atmosphere."
"We went to this charming little Italian on the basis of TripAdvisor reviews and were not disappointed. The food was tasty, good value and difficult to criticise.  It was not too busy when we went but I would like to visit when it it as I imagine the atmosphere would be terrific. "
Really lovely place to meet and eat. I liked the large garlic and rosemary bread. What's left to say. Go there
Very friendly staff and incredible food. Had the falafel wrap and did not disappoint. Also had the cheese and herb pastry which was lovely
"Been here many a time. Great service, great food. My favourute kebab, Authentic cuisine, will always be back!"
"I went there after work with my wife we loved the food, well cooked and served, Mr. Ali came to ask if it was our first visit when he brought complimentary sides for us. Would defiantly go again soon.We got our money's worth Highly Redmond !!"
"After hearing and reading the many positive reviews. Decided to try for myself.  I was really disappointed with the size and quality. The lamb doner had big pieces of chewy fat. Quite a lot of oil sitting in the bottom of the container. Prices differ between their website and what you pay in the shop. To me £10.90 for a mixed kebab of this quality, was a waste of money. The staff were very friendly, but the food really does need to improve. Won't be going again."
A really lovely Turkish takeaway which is fantastic for the local community. We've eaten from here twice now. The portions are generous and food tastes amazing. The chefs behind the counter are welcoming to everyone. You have to wait a little while for your food as they always seem to be busy but the food is well worth the wait! There's a great little seating area inside and also a bench outside which is great in the summer.
"My wife and I were staying about a block away for several days. Our AirBnB host mentioned EsTurkish, so we decided to check it out. We got the feast for two. It was so much food (about £20) that we ate on it for two meals. Very good flavors. Would go again if I was nearby. Very welcoming and gracious staff. "
Newly opened in Charlton. Great tasting food at reasonable prices.  Food is fresh with delicious bread which is made in the shop.
A new place in Charlton.  The places is modern & clean.The food very tasty & decent portions.There is always a queue inside so you know it's good!
Great food great customer service very nice and family feel first time and definitely not the last ..
"Happened upon this place while visiting London and it almost makes me sad to leave now. The food is fresh and authentic. The service is amazing. There is a lady there that makes the bread and bases for the pide and lahmachun before your eyes, there aren't words made to describe watching that, and then getting to enjoy it. The whole experience is an absolute treat. "
Finally got a decent proper turkish kebab shop in the area. Wide variety on the menu and kebabs served in proper homemade turkish bread!!. Recommend 100% ..
Very delicious and clean. Everything is fabulous. The staff is quite relevant. They're just a little busy ((:
A little piece of Italy a family run establishment only down fall cannot always be accommodated but worth waiting your turn
"I’m very lucky to live nearby, I’ve been coming to this resturant for years. I remember last year on a lovely warm evening feeling like I was on holiday as I sat outside dinning. This place is always busy and charming hosts to boot, I even love driving by smelling the aromas which come out of this place. Simply the best Italian food by far !"
Thank you Raffaele for a lovely meal tonight. The duck papardelle was the best ever and as always the friendly atmosphere was the best ever. See you soon now I'm living back on the right side of the river.
"Reasonably priced, family-run restaurant. Excellent food. I have had perfectly cooked frito misto and on another occasion beautiful, rich lamb shank. There's a warm welcome and good atmosphere. Wine's good too."
"Ate here when the owner's father ran it in his unique style. I thought it would be impossible to better the ambience of the old establishment but I was wrong. The food, service and atmosphere are terrific and we are lucky to be just around the corner."
"My wife and I love this restaurant. My wife is a vegetarian coeliac whilst I am a wheat eating carnivore, this restaurant maybe the only place in London where we both have an exceptional meal.  My wife loves the GF Dough Balls, I’m all about the various home made meaty Italian meals such as the Homemade Papardelle with Venison, or the Spicy Nuja pizza.  Great food, great wines and above all fantastic service. Whenever people visit we show off by taking them to Trattoria Raffaele"
"I visited Launceston place last sunday and took advantage of their 3 course for £26 Sunday menu. Well.. it is actually 5 courses once you count the amuse bouche and the free dessert that are thrown in. The food was exceptionally good. The starter of dug egg on toast with english truffles was one of the best things i have eaten all year. My wife's starter of betroot and beef risotto, light, tasty and stunning.  The main courses of longhorn roast beef and confit de canard with truffled turnips both had all of us groaning in appreciation. The treacle tart dessert with creme fraiche ice cream crowned a phenomenal lunch. The service was incredible, in particular the sommelier who was incredibly skilled but also relaxed enough to share some genuine humor with the group. My only complaint is that £4.00 for a tonic water and $4.50 for a coffee is a little cheeky!"
"A romantic dinner to finish great London weekend in the neighbourhood at The Gore hotel. Came here first time in the 80ies, when it was a small place with living room furniture. Still remember their wood pidgeon with red cabbage fondly. They must have moved accross the street? Much more stylish, almost a little intimidating. The apprehension passed quickly. Lobster starter one of the prettiest dishes I've ever seen, with taste and flavour to match. Suckling pig and lamb main courses very good, but not quite as memorable. Wine is decently priced and delivered by a very capable somellier from Chicago(!). Service impeccable and friendly. Very pleasant."
"I haven't been to this restaurant for about 8 years, and used to go there whenever i was in town as a haven from shopping/museums/noise. It still has a great location, a quiet haven in central London at the end of a street of lovely houses. It used to be quite expensive, good food, adequate service, but peaceful and relaxing, almost a hidden gem.  The lunchtime service was extremely slow, ie 90 mins before a relatively simple and poorly cooked starter arrived. The food itself was in the ""trying too hard"" category and was really poor.  I was served boiled a boiled potato in a pastry shell that was frankly inedible due to the amount of salt used, whilst our starters were without flavour. The cost of the meal was unjustifiable. We left after two courses after waiting 2.5 hours, but we still had an uncomfortable debate over the bill (we ordered a la carte but were charged and argued with about the set 3 course etc). Boring, annoying, slow, and a mistake. What a shame."
"My mother and I enjoyed a relaxing lunch here last Saturday. We both opted for the £20 3 course lunch menu which was superb. The menu offers a choice of 3 starters, 3 main courses and 3 desserts (one of which is cheese at £8.00 supplement). The fresh, warm bread was a delicious addition to the meal. I requested a vegetarian main course even though this wasn't on the menu and this was no problem at all. I was told the chef would make something 'special' for me. The result was a delectable array of beautifully cooked and presented vegetables with a garlic butter sauce / foam. Absolutely divine! To finish our meal we both chose Earl Grey tea. Rather then getting just a cup we were provided with a full teapot which makes a nice change. The accompanying mini raspberry sponges and vanilla cream were to die for! All the staff were polite and attentive. A great place to enjoy a relaxing couple of hours away from the hustle and bustle of London."
"When ever I’m in London I like to try at least one restaurant I’ve never been to before, some times I’m disappointed but occasionally I am trilled and this was definitely one of the latter. At first we walked pasted this little unassuming restaurant but when we finally found it I was delighted with the dark sumptuous feel of the interior. We quickly snuggled down in the bar sipping G&T’s to choose our food. The restaurant was lovely, dark and intimate. I had Beef tartar followed by lemon sole, both were incredible, but the lavender cream and strawberries was star of the night. Launceston Place is now on my list of restaurants to go back to, especially on a cold wet evening, as it lifts the soul and makes you feel all warm, cosy and satisfied."
"Raffaele took the restaurant over from his father (it used to be called the Montecassino) and has updated the decor and menu without losing any of it's charm or the quality of food and service. It is popular locally, so you need to book on weekends or special dates (Valentine's Day for example). The menu is traditional Italian with pizza and pasta as well as a variety of meat and fish dishes. The wine list is good too."
Has a good basic menu that doesn't change from month to month. The specials can be good value and currently has a excellent lunchtime deal for about a tenner.
"Fantastic pizzas, friendly service thoroughly recommended"
"The owners of the establishment really know what they are doing. They are very caring for the customers. The food is always deliciously prepared and very good value for money. Home made bread and other delicious Turkish dishes. The meat tastes like the finest quality. The decor is understated, clean and homely. They are all very friendly.  One time, I ordered from deliveroo and deliveroo were late at finding a rider to deliver the food but eaTurkish put some bread in our order just to make up for it and kept the food warm (which was unbelievable because we waited for a whole hour and a half).  For me, this is the best Turkish takeaway in London.  Only criticism is the opening times aren’t very clear sometimes but still love this place!"
"Have made numerous visits since my last review. Still love this restaurant.Always a warm welcome. Have tried the pide & lahmacun as well as doner kebab, and sides also very tasty. Puddings a real guilty pleasure..."
"It was awesome. Food was great and we left nothing behind. 3 adults and 2 kids. Great dining, perfectly priced."
This is a small bistro style place with friendly service good selection meze and great tasty doner kebap which is prepared by real meat cuts
"Food: chicken is very tender, lamb - delicious! We also always order a combination of humus, tzatziki, olives etc as s starter - try and you will not regret!  Staff: friendly and polite. They have personal friendly relationships with many returning customers.  Interior: it’s a simple take- away place - 6-9 places inside, 4 outside. There are some loverly decorations on the brick wall. Price: £7 for a standard chicken shish.  they have new deals available - see on the picture. Other: last year they switched from plastic cutlery to a more nature friendly option  Overall: excellent. When we want a kebab, we do not even mind crossing the river by car to come here"
"We live just down the road from this place - we go there too much!Food is amazing, staff are all friendly and helpful, cooked fresh and don't have to wait too long.If it's busy they even offer people samples/tasters. Would highly recommend!"
Still no good over priced . Same low quality very expensive.8 quid small kebab .nowhere to parl 0 stars
Had high expectations since I checked it’s rating. We were staying nearby and got lucky with this place. I checked the rating once we ordered and were very satisfied with the kebabs. Took a little longer than the norm because they cooked it to perfection. While we waited they handed out free slices of pizza to customers. Very good service and very friendly. Highly recommend chaps.
I was on a cycle tour from Thamesmead to Greenwich and back on Saturday and I could not resist going in to have a kebab. Even with my cycle gear their food and great service was beckoning. It was almost like someone was standing outside gesturing 'come in'. That's how good their food is. Their homemade bread is what sets the apart from other kebab joints. Other places you get the normal pitta bread but they make their own which makes a huge difference.
"Me (Kaiser) and my friend (Usman) went to try this place a few days ago, we didn't know what to expect, we were very surprised we ordered Lamb Donor & Chicken Donor with bread. It was amazing! The service was also amazing. This place will become our regular place to eat from now on."
"Food was prepared very well, tasted delicious, staff were very friendly and accommodating. You will not be disappointed."
"What a treat!!! Popped in for a quick bite and was welcomed by super friendly staff, a well kept shop,a veggie friendly menu and some of the best home made bread I've ever had. Not only can I HIGHLY recommend this place but I can't wait until I'm hungry enough to try the Pides!!! "
"Amazing value for money, loads of choices so there's something for everyone, it's also halal and looks like it's family run"
"Fresh ingredients, delicious kebabs, really good price, friendly staff, great portions... worth travelling to!"
"The Charlton area is not well served by good quality take away restaurants. Much of the food ordered from the various Chinese, Indian and Chicken shops is overly salty, greasy and pretty tasteless. This is thankfully not the case for EaTurkish. I had my second meal there this evening and was so impressed with the freshness of the food and the quality of the service. It seems like most of the food is freshly made on site including the delicious breads and pizzas (pine). Yes, yes the kebabs are great but it's when one gets into the humus, vine leaves, Pides and chicken that that it really gets interesting. Best of all, one finishes the food without that slightly guilty or regretful feeling one often has when eating take away food. Instead you feel satisfied that you have had an authentic, home made feast which has been prepared with pride and care. A VERY welcome addition to Charlton. "
"Outstanding kebab. Excellent quality, always fresh and reasonably priced. Lots of other Turkish food on the menu and always very busy!"
Always friendly service. Great food always prepared fresh. Having visited Turkey  the food from Ali is much better than some Turkish restaurant in Turkey.
I've been here a number of times and their food (and service) is fantastic! Glad there's a new local!
"Possibly the best kebab you'll find in London. All freshly cooked meat and everything you would expect from a 'real' turkish kebab. However, my last few waits in the shop have been nearly 30 minutes or I'd be giving a 5* rating."
Very friendly service and amazingly good food; as good as any I've had in Turkey. A much needed addition to the food offerings in this area.The home made bread is a must have....
"This was our first visit to this renowned restaurant, and I'm sure it won't be the last. The service was friendly (our waiter was happy to speak with us in Italian) and efficient. Things were brought to the table with just the right sort of interval between them. The decor seems a little dated, but there were some fun touches. The music alternated nicely (and discretely) between Frank Sinatra and Luciano Pavarotti - perfect! The house wine was fine, the sardines (starter) much better than I would have anticipated, bread was lovely, the two pasta dishes (pappardelle and ravioli) both very fresh tasting. The pappardelle had a lovely rosemary flavour and rather more rabbit than one would expect. The ravioli had a touch too much sauce, but that could be catering for the English market, however the filling was excellent. Tiramisu was good although not outstanding, and the same could be said of the coffee (however, in a place which - probably because of speaking Italian with the waiter - reminded me of Italy I am probably comparing those things to the best I have had in that country).  We spent £60 between us (including service) which is a good and, I would say, reasonable price. Some of the best Italian food I have had in the UK."
"Brilliant night, great home food, you simply can't beat the place for quality and value.My family really enjoyed the evening, thanks Team Rafa"
I went here after reading the trip advisor reviews and I was not disappointed. The dough balls are great very recommended in my opinion. All the food tastes very fresh and large portions. We had to have boxes to take home. Service was quick and polite.  Will definitely be returning! 
"I went with my wife to Launceston Place on Saturday 3rd July. On arriving they didn't have our booking (it transpired that they had booked us in for the 30th, and not the 3rd). They managed to fit us in anyway, and we went for the three course £20 menu.  We started with home made devilled crisps, and some warm bread. The amuse bouche was a small glass cup containing a dollop of ice cold natural yoghurt, with pickled cucumber, a drop of oil, and seeds of some sort. Perfect for a summer lunchtime.  To start I had gone for the duck egg with toast and truffles, and my wife went for the ""beef, beetroot and wild garlic risotto"" (it's not really a risotto, as there's no rice, just finely chopped beetroot). We thought both were delicious (apart from the large blobs of bone marrow, but each to their own).  The main course of Lamb (shank) with mash was excellent, and I had the pork crubeens which were outstanding. We were then given a small pre-dessert of Pimms jelly with lemon and lime granita. We both had the dark chocolate and rasberry mouse for dessert, which again was superb. Finally we were presented with a post-dessert of beautiful miniature rasberry cakes with whipped cream. I had a gin and tonic, a couple of glasses of a very nice Reisling, and we had water and tea, and the whole lot came to only £84 excluding service. That, in my opinion, is a true bargain, and we will certainly be going again. Get in there whilst the lunch menu is still so cheap, as it shouldn’t be long before Tristan gets a well deserved Michelin star at Launceston Place."
"My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary here and we were not disappointed at all. Fantastic. Food delicious, well presented etc etc. From the moment we walked into Launceston Place the service we received was impeccable. We chose from the set dinner menu which for London prices was great value. In between courses they offered little extra courses which was a nice added bonus in our opinion. We can't wait to go back."
"Myself and my partner booked a table here on Sunday 25th. Service - fantastic, 3 waiters, I think? all very attentive and what you would expect for a restaurant of such a high standard Decor - Comfortable and spacious seating, loved the way a table of two is sat so as to be non intrusive to the next table, the only thing I was slightly unkeen on were the dark (possibly black) walls although that is just my personal opinion, I feel the decor could be a little lighter Wine/food - we were slightly overwelmed (in a good way) of the choice of wine, I picked a reasonably priced South African for £35, was one of the nicesest wines I have ever tasted and complimented our AMAZING food! I wont bore you with the list of what we ate, but I will say it was the nicest well presented perfectly cooked food I have ever tastest and we will definately be back. Thank you Launceston for a perfect 5 star foodie experience."
"Visit - 27/06/2010 Me, and a whole variety of my relatives visited Launceston Place on the date above for what turned out to be a spectacular afternoon of food, wine and entertainment. Me and my better half had already been here once, after seeing Tristan and Steve on Great British Menu and Masterchef The Proffesionals respectively. We booked the 'Chef's Office' which is your own room downstairs, candlelit, with a direct TV offed to the kitchen, the option to go into the kitchen while the chefs are cooking, and the opportunity to have each meal explained to you by a chef. Dishes on the tasting menu with wine included - British Asparagus with sweet sicily, sunflower seeds and snails - Warm mackrel served with picked onion and cucumber - Braised lamb with wilted lettuce - A spread of all of the 'best of' desserts, including smoked chocolate fondant, raspberry ripple cream ice cream, whisky ice cream, a raspberry mousse on chcolate mousee and the legendary Tatre Tartain A stunning, stunning afternoon. Thank you Launceston place. We will be back."
"If I’m in the mood for Turkish cuisine then EaTurkish is always priority, awesome food for a reasonable price with really friendly staff make it impossible to not return.  Though it being cash only can make it a pain there is an Asda just a 5 minute walk away with free cash machines to use.  Though it’s not exactly local to me, EaTurkish is worth the £1.50 bus ride as I know I’m going to get something great, they’re going to have my business for a long time."
"I have been few times now to EatTurkish and it is literally one of the best turkish places I have been to. The homemade bread is amazing, the prices are really good for you get and the service is at a very high level."
"Family owned business with friendly atmosphere, fresh produces and freshly made bread, to eat in or take away. For italian-speakers: uno dei miei posti preferiti in Londra per qualcosa di semplice fatto con amore!"
Very nice food especially lamb kofte. The bread is homemade and is very light and fluffy. Also the condiments are homemade coleslaw and chilli sauces.
"Amazing lunch in this wonderful restaurant, great food and service, well done guys you deserve every success!!!"
Ben Murphy is an extraordinary young chef with a very bright future.His food is stratospheric - he pushes the boundaries with his innovation and creativity The thirty five pound three course menu with a glass of bubbly in addition to tasters and amuse bouche  The cured sea bream with asparagus and the cod with lemongrass veloute were beautifully prepared freshly sourced with the most exquisite and complementary flavours
"Absolutely superb! The service was perfect for us, friendly very knowledgeable and professional waiters and sommelier. The food was top notch - amongst the best if not THE best we have ever tasted. We do not visit London very often but will have to go again soon just to dine at Launceston Place! Perfect in every way!"
"I ate here about 2 weeks ago, having previously visited in 2017. I was so looking forward to it, and all was as good as I remembered! As before we visited using the Evening standard offer, so started with a very nice class of Cava. The food is delicious; beautifully presented, very tasty small portions, which means you can enjoy 3 courses and all the delicious extras that you are given! The staff are delightful, and manage to be there when you need them and so discrete when you do not. I think this is a very special place so would really recommend. I do think at lunchtime it is a perfect spot for a ladies lunch! Hopefully I will be back next time without a 2 year gap!"
"Not having visited before, I was unsure what to expect, but armed with TripAdvisor reports I hoped for the best. I opted for the pre-theatre prix fixe and it was delightful as was the quality of service. Highly recommend."
Beautifully presented three-course menu with snacks and very decently-priced wine. Staff superb and decor befitting a cool style of food creation.
"My partner and I have ordered food from EaTurkish several times and the quality is always fantastic. On top of that, the service is always friendly, welcoming and efficient."
This is the one of the famous restaurant i go in London because the way they cook the food and serve. You can see your food cooking front of you and they make fresh salad and bread also made in the restaurant and its really tasteful. I dont agree why people give 1 starr if time-out choose 4 and 5 stars every year then they dont have to judge the restaurant as a 1 star because people in timeout go to restaurant and eat and look at the service and food so they know what they doing...
"We were at an early evening concert around the corner from this restaurant and popped in without a reservation. There was some consultation with the chefs before we were given a table. Once the food began to arrive, I understood why. Everything was exquisitely and individually prepared to the most sublime quality. There were many small plates offered by way of appetiser before the arrival of the ordered starters and they were all delicious and prepared with delicacy and to perfection. Each course was then of exactly the right quantity and wonderful to savour. We enjoyed some good burgundy and claret to accompany the food. Slight shame was that the sommelier was not too good at looking after us! That notwithstanding , I recommend this restaurant for the fabulous food and wine list. It is perhaps more for a special occasion rather than an every day affair. For us it was a real bonus to have ended up there unexpectedly!"
"Superb food, price and service. Was recommended by a bartender in dolston as the place is apparently known for good food."
"I was trying to find a decent restaurant near the Hackney Downs Studios where I could join a friend for dinner before an event. I figured anything within the top 2000 restaurants in London would be decent and this place comes in the top 500! It did not disappoint! The frontage is very unassuming and it was a week day evening, so reasonably quiet. This didn't stop great service and absolutely delicious food being served up, at very reasonable prices. I really wish I lived closer and had a reason to stop by more regularly - highly recommended!"
The best turkish restaurant in london l love it x l go there 2 ice a week food nice servis nice and i will recommended u gays 2 go there u will love it ...
We dined as a couple during our weekend in London. A little off the beaten track but a real gem. Subtle lighting and simple but stylish decor. Thought it was going to be a little pretentious but once we were shown our table the staff were extremely courteous and helpful. Spectrum of wine to suit all tastes and pockets. Food was definately a dining experience which we will remember as one the best we experienced. Hubby was a little disappointed with the amount of cheese for his dessert particular given the £8 supplement. Will go on the list of a place to re-visit.
"We had spent an enormous amount of money the previous evening on a meal so went for the pre theatre 3 course meal of a set menu which I thought was reasonably priced. The evening started well with snacks (amuse bouche) which were intricate and delicious and I felt the service was excellent. I was shocked when my first course of beef tartare arrived. Slightly bigger then a 2 pence piece and not much thicker. All very nice but gone in a moment. I hoped the main would be better but the belly pork I received was a cube no bigger than a inch and half cube, probably smaller. Flavour was good but again I just thought this was taking the Micky. I have eaten at fine dining establishments on a number of occasions and wasn’t expecting big portions but these were beyond a joke. The rhubarb dessert consisted of a few slivers of actual rhubarb served with a tiny amount of ice cream. If these courses had been part of an eight course tasting menu then they may have been appropriate but as a three course meal they definitely weren’t. I cannot knock the service or the flavours although we were a little underwhelmed by the flavour of the desert. All the courses were very well presented. I left the restaurant feeling extremely disappointed which is a shame as we had both been looking forward to it. Walking back to the hotel I had a coffee and a piece of apple cake as I was honestly still hungry."
Very nice restaurant. The food is excellent with lots of extras. Recommend to order the tasting menu with wine pairing.
"Absolutely exquisite! We love this restaurant. Our most favourite restaurant across the globe. Saturday night is a set menu costing GBP 85. You can add wine pairing for GBP 64. I would highly recommend doing this because Piotr the sommelier, is absolutely world class. His stories about the wine that is being paired are interesting, informative and entertaining. I would take this option just to hear what he has to say. Every dish is presented in an outstanding manner. The taste is simply divine. There is a small bar area at the front of the restaurant where you can have a pre-dinner drink. We did this last night but I would not necessarily say this is essential. They serve some pre-dinner snacks when you are first seated and ‘my helpful hint is that you order a glass of champagne at the table to enjoy with the snacks.’ There is quite a lot of wine that will be served if you take the pairing option but it is all high quality and mixes perfectly with the food. I can only say: for your next special occasion, make a booking and go. Actually, you don’t need a special occasion to go. Make a booking and celebrate anything you can imagine. This is one restaurant you must experience. Highly recommended."
"Been here with friends on a couple of occasions and the whole experience was superb. Delicious food (all courses, the eggs and soldiers is a must), excellent service, beautiful setting - what’s not to like! Already looking forward to our next visit - see you guys soon! "
"Fresh and very tasty, best chicken and lamb shish. Very friendly staff. Homemade bread is the real deal. We travel over 10 miles."
"Excellent Turkish food, with friendly and generous staff who prepare everything fresh. Best kebab I've had in a long time (and that was in Berlin)."
Can’t fault this take away that just has a very small eat in table. Everything gone made and freshly cooked. Can’t fault service or quality of food. Will def be back ☺️
"Gave this place a punt because of the excellent reviews.  We were made welcome on entering, which was a good start. The one table they have was free so we got seated. Within a few minutes a cold Meze landed on our table with some warm bread. A pleasant surprise. I went for the garlic mushrooms to start and they were fantastic. The three of us had different kebabs and all were universally enjoyed. Go for the set menus as they are great value and  one small gripe is the price for the chicken wings. £6.50 for 7 pieces is steep. One wing has two parts so £6.50 for 3 and 1/2 wings. Don’t let that put you off, give it a go"
I had the chicken donor with the fresh bread and it was delicious! Service was the great and always curtious with their customer. We got a free meze platter!
"I've walked past this shop many times and theres usually people inside. the food has looked good from the outside and I've always thought I should go. I'm really glad I went tonight and will go back soon. the bread is made in house and you can tell. both the garlic and chilli sauces were excellent. meat was tender and delicious. salad tasted fresh. I really felt like the people making the food really cared about what they were doing and this was evident in the food. all was cooked to order. if you have read this far just go, we had 4 different things and all were worth it."
"If you like or want to try Turkish food, go to No:19! Simply awesome meats, salads, sides and most importantly, bread. Awesome, awesome"
What a great find.  Greek salad with feta fab chicken special beyti with yoghurt sauce was Devine and  Sami our waiter was so helpful.  Finishing off with Turkish tea
Was treated to a meal here last night by a friend who lives locally. I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers. I love Turkish food but this knocks spots off all the others I have tried.Loved the salads.Service swift and friendly and a good glass of wine too!
"The food is exceptional with excellent attention to detail. Flavours were well balanced across the menu. We had wine pairing which worked very well. One guest doesn't eat eggs and the menu was adapted perfectly. Service is flawless, we felt extremely relaxed and welcomed. Given the level of quality the price is great value. We will definitely visit again at the first opportunity."
"A quick trip this time to Launceston Place for a pre-theatre dinner. The set menu was absolutely incredible. I had the crab to start followed by short rib and finally pineapple. All presented beautifully and the flavour was divine. This is definitely a quality over quantity experience - don't expect huge portions but if you are looking for a food experience then this is the place for you. The service was excellent, attentive and skillful - we will be back"
"The place is incredibly beautiful but the service is extremely slow, we had 4 courses menu and took more than 2 hours, considering the size of the dishes  The food is very tasty but definitively not enough. We had starters from a la carte menu and the 3 courses set menu but still very small portions but no doubt the quality is astonishing, full of flavours and textures I believe to fully enjoy the experience the best option would be the tasting menu In the other hand the service is superb the ambience and customer service is 5 stars"
"Loved the place and the food. The restaurant was elegant yet casual. The food was beautifully presented and flavorful We opted for the three course menu. In addition to the three courses, we were served three lovely amuse bouches and warm bread with flavored butter. Absolutely delightful. Next time we are in London, will come back for the longer tasting menu. Highly recommended!"
"Selected as the nearest quality restaurant after an evening recital at the Royal college of music, Launceston place exceeded expectations. Very nice petit fours, and a small selection of high quality main courses including turbot and iberico pork. Two huge chips accompanying the main courses came in their own tiny shopping trolley - a nice touch. Pleasant atmosphere and good service highly recommended if you're in the area."
Once again an amazing meal at Launceston Place. Dining solo for the first time there after previously dining with others I was made to feed welcome and given extraordinary service. Every dish of the tasting menu was delicious and presented in a delightful manner. It was again the highlight of a trip to London for this foodie. 
Amazing place a lovely place to take a sit and enjoy the food which is beautifully presented to us to eat.
We went specially to Cırrık because of good reviews on Tripadvisor and were disappointed. Good service and good sized portions. Mixed cold mezze were good. Hot falafel starter was a bit tasteless as was the hummus. Courgette fritters were undercooked and tasteless. Meat main courses were average. We wouldn’t return. Better places in the wonderfully lively Green Lanes area. 
"It’s a cosy space that smells good, and they handled it beautifully on learning one of us needed to catch a train a little sooner than is ideal and another with allergy issues. Tasty food, good service and fast enough that I caught that train.  Also lovely to watch the skilful knifework behind the counter."
"Great Turkish restaurant in Dalton that our daughter took us to on Mother’s Day. Really buzzing place. We sat quite. Close to the preparation area and it was great to see the chef slicing onions and tomatoes with such consummate ease. Followed our daughter’s advise and collectively ordered two main dishes, four starters and some salad plates amongst the four of us and that worked really well. Flatbread and tsatziki was great and the salad was very fresh with the squeezed lemon. Also had the Esme, finely chopped salad with pomegranate dressing which was a surprising star! But certainly eclipsed by the seasoned lamb chops cooked on charcoal grill which were very tender.  Starters included Imam Bayildi and sauté tiger prawns in tomato sauce with garlic. Our mains included Tavuk Beyt Yogurtlu which was great and is described as Charcoaled minced breast of chicken with garlic and parsley wrapped and sliced in lavash bread served with yoghurt and tomato sauce with fresh mint.  The other main was But certainly eclipsed by the seasoned lamb chops cooked on charcoal grill which were very tender.  Lush!"
Visited with friends early evening. A small restaurant with typical Turkish food which was absolutely Devine. Really tender lamb kebabs with fresh salad. Would definitely go back.
"I was tossing up between going to Mangal 1 or 2 but went to this place instead. Wow it didn't disappoint! It was amazing food, I had the Bostan chicken which was an aubergine stuffed with chicken and spices and it was mouth watering! I would definitely come back again. The service was good too, bonus!"
"Small restaurant, nice atmosphere, fresh food, good quality! Great staff! Perfect for lunch and dinner!"
"We were a party of 12 wanting a meal before going to see a band in Stoke Newington. We came across this restaurant and what a find! A Fabulous family run restaurant doing authentic Turkish food. We were well looked after and the food was delicious. We would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the area especially if you love Turkish food, great value too!!"
"We had the most amazing meal! Great service, low key setting and the most incredible Turkish food I’ve ever eaten. Still dreaming about it days later!"
"We have come here regularly after a recommendation over the last 2 years and the simple look of the restaurant understates the magnificent quality and flavour of the food - from the breads dipped in meat and toasted on the grill for flavour, to the delicious salad and the astoundingly tasty chicken beyti (the wow dish for us) and the staple chicken or lamb shish - it is all truly magnificent on each occasion and better than anything else we have tried locally in Dalton. I also like the fact it is family owned and run - they care about the food and the client service."
"Top quality vibes and delicious food! The restaurant couldn't have been any more accommodating and warm especially the waitress.  The food was made and arrived within a reasonable time despite there being a group of over 20 people!  Would definitely dine here again and highly recommend to anyone.   No regrets celebrating my birthday here!  Thank you everyone for Friday night, thoroughly enjoyed myself as did everyone else I was with"
"First and last time I visit this nasty restaurant.  In a nut shell....  the waiter obviously has no idea of customer service or politeness, ""wat u want"" ""beer, you want beer"" were his only words, no ""are you very for me to take your order"". We were waiting for another friend to turn up and each time the waiter came over to take our order the more angry and frustrated he became.  I had ordered a special hot vegetarian salad, (with two big red stars next to the name on the menu), well I thought it must be great to have two big red stars. Sadly I was completely wrong! What was presented on my plate resembled the leftovers of last nights rubbish bin. A few peppers, onions and courgettes fried in lots of oil, with a paltry portion of rice, this cost the best part of £12. The dish was swamped in this sweet sticky pomegranate sauce which resembled bile, in look and taste. I wouldn't feed this muck to the dogs and I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone."
"We came here for a friends birthday dinner, we each had a standard lamb kebab type thing, and one had fish. I was told the fish was good; you could see it being cooked in front of you along with the meat on the grill. It was all cooked to order, and whilst we waited, we were given plenty of hummus and bread, this was cooked over the meat and so had the most wonderful flavour. the service was good; attentive, and the alcohol was fairly cheap. The price was not bad either, we left feeling very full and had each had 3 beers for about £20 including tip! Recommended."
"Visiting a friend in Dalston who took us here for dinner. What a taste sensation. Houmous, olives, pomegranate onions (amazing) et beyti (stunning) I could eat here every night if I didn't live in Scotland (dammit) Staff were very friendly too.Love it x"
"Come here for good, cheap Turkish food that's as popular with the local Turkish community as it is with the cool kids.  It's far from the fanciest place you can eat but the staff are always nice and most importantly the food is always on point.  You can book here so it's good for groups. Vegetarians will walk away as full and satisfied as the meat-eaters. Would recommend going on a weeknight rather than a weekend as it can get super busy and the kitchen can get a bit overwhelmed. Just order another Efes, watch the grill man do his thing, and you'll be fine! You can't go wrong with the grilled meet and Pide, but trust me when I say The Et Beyti Yogurtlu and the spinach and egg pide are must try."
The place is buzzling with life on a Saturday evening which is nice. I had booked a table for 9 people and when we arrived we were told that we had to wait 20 minutes. 30 minutes later our table was ready. We did not mind waiting and the manager was friendly and offered us some drinks whilst waiting. Starters were good but we were all a bit disappointed with the main dish. It was not that tasty unfortunately. Wine + Starters + food we spend 20 pounds per head.
"After a bit of a lay off we were back at Cirrick last night. We kept it simple and had the mixed kebab. It was comforting to see the usual mound of delicious smokily grilled juicy lamb, tender chicken, an Adana kebab and little jewels of soft and yielding liver. Alongside were the always welcome complimentary salads which burst with flavour. I particularly love the caramelised quartered onions dressed with pomegranate juice. Bread was good though not stunning. The rice under the meat had absorbed the juices to become a fantastic last treat when all the bones were stripped clean. We had an Efes and a turnip juice to drink. Not much to say about the former. It was Efes, it came in a bottle, it was cold. But the turnip juice had real depth of flavour and provided refreshment you just don't get from the usual non-alcoholic suspects. Service was lovely from all three staff members. You don't go here for the decor or a glamorous ambience. It's buzzy, you feel a little squeezed in and you're not going to have those intimate conversations for fear of being overheard. But above all it's fun. Other diners tend to be a mix of Turkish groups and families, the odd Stokey couple 'keeping it real', and the young antifashion brigade. So all in all lots of facial hair but not much facial topiary - unusual for Dalston on a Friday night. All in it was under 35 quid for two (the mixed grill could easily serve three more restrained folk). Beware, they don't take cards."
"We ate here on Sat 24/4/10 and what a wonderful dinner we had. The restaurant feels comfortable and intimate with the subdued lighting adding to the atmosphere. The food was lovely with everything being of excellent quality and the portion sizes were very good compared to other fine dining establishments. The staff were all very professional and on hand to offer advice on wine choices etc. This doesn't seem to be a tourist restaurant so you feel like one of the well heeled locals which is a bonus on a trip to London. Although this restaurant is not cheap, we both felt that we got what we paid for and we will definately return on our next visit to London."
"Few questions that have come to my mid after visiting this place... Firstly - why potatoes were served in the plastic bag which had to be cut open with scissors by the waiter? Over the top and so silly...  Secondly - why all the dishes I tried weren't seasoned and therefore appeared tasteless? Thirdly - why my chocolate pudding smelled and tasted like a piece of charcoal? Also where was that famous Islay whisky in it? Not even a hint of it... This is a restaurant for Nouveau riche which never had a decent meal and can be impressed with anything... Bad, bad, bad..."
"Ate here last Friday the 22nd of January, my sixth visit and as in the past it didn't disappoint. Tristan Welch's food is excellent and the lunch menu at £20.00 for three courses with bread and two amuse-bouche is fantastic value. Big choice of fairly priced wine, pleasant service, all in all a great experience. Had the lobster bisque, pork and to finish the apple tart, we had the last one, as its highly reccomended I suggest you order it at the beginning. By comparison to the overall bargain the cheese as a separate course at £10.00 could be considered a tad pricey but its a small point."
Honestly one of the best Turkish places I've been.  You need to look no further when you're in Greenwich an amazing find and especially Haroon who served us with 5-star service if you like Turkish food what are you waiting for. Had the kebabfest for 2 people and we were stuffed. Enjoy!!!!!!!!!! 
The decor is lovely and the staff are very helpful and friendly.The food was really tasty and we were even given a free meze starter and sweet desert .Thank you
"Authentic Turkish food, the best spare ribs, liver and onions that I've ever had. The kusbasi pide is delicious. Everything that we've tasted on the menu has never disappointed us. The complimentary salads and bread and friendly service what more could you ask for? One of the best amongst lots of other Turkish restaurants in Dalston. We always end up going back because it's simply a delight."
I love this place. The service is lovely and personable and the food is amazing. I love that they bring you a whole bunch of free onion based salads (I'm crazy about the onion and pomegranate combo) and you come out feeling sooo full... probably because the bread is just as irresistible as the mains.
Yummy kebabs! Lamb shish was delicious... Spiced minced kebab was tantalizing. Lots of onions turned up in various formats -- all fantastic. Reasonable prices for such quality and nice service!
"We were a group of 20 on Saturday night. There were not enough wine glasses on the table for the number of people. We politely asked for more. We were told that they were on the table, it took a while for us to plead for enough glasses. We were brought menus. There were not enough. We asked for more and were told to share (1 menu between 2 is fine, but 1 between 4?). We thought that the food would make up for the unfriendly service received so far, after all the reviews were all good. We ordered starters and mains. Starters arrived quickly. I had the hallumi cheese, which I thought would be grilled but was actually deep fried. My fault for not clarifying and not to my taste, but that's not their fault. Everyone seemed to enjoy the starters and the bread was lovely. We then had over a 90 minute wait for the mains with no apology or explanation that we would be waiting for so long. I ordered the mixed kebab which was described as a meal for one person on the menu. It wasok. My friend ordered the mixed kebab described on the menu as for 2-3 people for himself and his girlfriend. They said they wanted the mixed kebab for 2. What they got was the same kebab as me, for one person. When they tried to ask the waiter what had happened, he shrugged and told them they should have asked for the full kebab (this was not clear in the menu). Everyone seemed to enjoy their food but it was nothing special, especially considering the service and after waiting for so long, you would enjoy your good. When finished, we had to ask for the bill several times. Most people were paying cash. My wife asked the waiter to please bring the card machine. The waiter told her they only accepted cash. I had half of it and we borrowed from another friend. The waiter told us that a cash machine was outside but the nearest was actually 10 min walk away. As we were leaving we saw other people paying by card, and on their door a sign saying they welcomed cards. Well they were not welcoming to us and we were not drinking and rowdy, we were not rude so I do not know the place that all of the other reviewers went to as it seems we were at a different place :("
"Exquisite food for a lovely long lazy Saturday lunchtime. We deliberately went on a bank holiday weekend hoping most people would be away - they were so it didn't matter that we hadn't booked. I am writing this review as a tribute to the wonderful staff who were all friendly, kind, attentive and most of all properly trained. So often a good restaurant is let down when this is not the case and even the most delicious food does not begin to make up for it. I had my first introduction to orange wine which was clearly explained to me by the young lady sommelier and our waiter (M...) had just the right amount of humour to deal with two very discerning older people! Thank you all, absolute pleasure and we will be back!"
"I had the pleasure of visiting Launceston place for my girlfriend’s birthday. Impeccable service, knowledge of the front of house was outstanding and the food... just incredible. A special thanks goes to Head Chef Ben and Sandro who made this possible.  Fabulous night, fabulous food, fabulous service."
"Quite a small menu, but excellent choices. Presentation was a little quirky but that did not detract from the food - sauces (or jus!) in particular were very good. A 'must have' is the Pistachio Souffle..... yum yum!"
"Seriously good Turkish food in an unpretentious, low-fuss setting. If you've got the time, order the lamb casserole. It takes 45 minutes but is worth the wait. Service is friendly, and I should note is family-run. You'll see Dad on the grill and his daughter working the floor on Fridays and Saturdays. Whilst they do serve wine and beer, I'd grab a good bottle or two from Newcomer Wines on your way up and make the most of the £5 corkage. We live in south London and go out of our way to come here as the food is fantastic."
Class food and service. Just get the lamb chops. Houmous starter brilliant. The sides were lovely along with the meal.
"Having found this restaurant on Trip Advisor we were not disappointed. The young woman serving us was friendly, helpful and attentive, just what anyone wants from their waitress. We opted for the mixed grill with a side of hummus and although I am not a massive eater, my husband is and it was enough for both of us. A selection of beautifully cooked meats and a whole array of fresh delicious salad accompaniments. Very reasonably priced, well cooked food in a friendly atmosphere. Highly recommend."
"After we ordered the mixed meze starter, the waiter warned us to share a main course rather than having one each. He was not wrong. A huge amount of food appeared at the table, all of it cooked to perfection and very tasty. The main course was just as good. They do corkage so you can bring your own wine, which is a bonus. They also serve good Turkish lager. The waiters were very friendly and polite. The restaurant has a nice ambience. Highly recommended."
"Came here last night for a friends birthday in a big group we were so well looked after, the food and service was absolute perfect. Thank you!"
"Perhaps a selection of starters was a bad idea, especially as served with freshly made bread. When our lamb filled aubergines arrived we were already feeling full. But I’m glad we visited; glad we had starters as well as main course and glad I don’t need to eat much at all tomorrow!"
Wow! What an absolute treat. The menu was varied and creative and the food was just delicious. It's a very casual laid back restaurant so if you want glamour choose elsewhere. But if you want good food at food reasonable prices with huge portions this is definitely the place! We left with doggy bags and enough for lunch the next day. Absolutely fantastic. 
"We are regulars here. The main reason for this is the difficulty in getting into Mangal, which is situated round the corner. Cirrik deserves a visit on its own merits. They have an excellent selection of starters. In fact, they are the best in the area for meze. You need to know the menu, as the list is actually too large and some dishes do come out of the tin (the baked beans). However, I think that they do the best liver around. Their Hummus leaves a tang on the tongue, their hellim a deep fried delight. When we first visited, we were most struck with the fresh, warm bread that has been soaking up the kebab juices and the onion salad dressed in pomegranate molasses. They would earn a fifth star, if they were able to maintain this quality in their kebabs. Unfortunately, they don’t. The meat is a bit dry and over salted. There is no Doner, chops or chicken wings in their mixed grill. We therefore ordered a dish of Pirzola to complement the mixed grill. The quality of the meat just can’t compete with Mangal. We received excellent service. We are always looked after here. They also allow you to bring your own wine with only £5 corkage. Cirrik offers Mangal reasonable competition. They win on starters and service. However, if you are just interested in the meat, you need to go to Arcola Street."
"Another nice afternoon of Turkish food in this area of London. This is the second Turkish restaurant we have tried in this area, and there are many to choose from. The food was great although being a Sunday afternoon it didn't have the same buzz as the last one we went to. Service was good and overall value for money."
"I have been coming to this restaurant for years with my family because of the exceptionally good food and friendly service. My view has gone downhill (and beyond) upon my recent visit. The new front of house manager was rude and ignorant from the off set. He had no concept of how to speak to customers even though he spoke better English than the usual ( much friendlier and efficient) staff. He came over very agitated everytime we wanted to order something extra asking ""what do you want?"" instead of "" how can i help/ what would you like"" (which is basic customer service I would have thought). We had sent an untouched dish back as there was a long strand of thick curly hair in the rice and was told that another dish would be brought out. However, they added this to the bill and tried to tell us that it was an extra dish that we had ordered. When we asked to speak to the ""boss"", the guy said "" the boss is working in the back, he can't come out"". They also refused to split the bill when we had asked from the start to have two separate bills running as there were two parties at the table. After we had refused to pay for the ""hairy"" dish, the ""manager"" told us not to come back. Charming. Definitely won't be setting foot in here again."
"Went at lunchtime and had the set menu. Absolutely unbeatable value for the three flawless courses which followed. A very unique, rambling layout which adds to the privacy and cosyness of the venue. Can't wait to go again and hit the a la carte! Nice, down to earth service too."
"Wonderful. Location, decor, staff, gastronomy were all exceptional and we return here again and again."
"The launceston is trendy but tastefully decorated in a lovely area. The entire staff treated us in an impeccable way, without overdoing it and we were really made comfortable and treated as guests. the team's efforts made this a wonderful experience. The food itself, by Chef Tristan Welsh is superb. the choice menu was 45 pounds and worth every penny. He can make things you have already eaten taste a different way. the salmon we had was wonderfull as were the scallops. One could really taste the sea. Treat yourself to this restaurant but book well in advance."
"SUMMARY: Top to bottom emphasis on quality, no staff or food slackers evident. Beautiful place. A little pricey for U.S. dollar people. PROS:  1) Staff were highly trained and took their business seriously while maintaining a casual ambiance and managing to avoid falling in overbearingness and pretentiousness 2) Excellent adventurous food 3) Beautiful place, nice neighborhood CONS: 1) Pricey for Americans CONS:"
"Staff, atmosphere and most of all food, all excellent, nothing else to say except I want to go again."
Chef Tristan made our wedding anniversary with our children a complete success. We had dinner at the chef office. The only word to describe the dinner is magnificent. The food was great and they took care of our allergies. They were specially nice with our 2 grand daughters. It was more than a meal it was an experience. Thank you to all who made this wonderful anniversary memorable.
"Good value for money, very good food and friendly staff. Great choice. Perfect for take away orders and for eating in."
Great Turkish cuisine and grills. Polite staff and tasty dishes. Place to go whenever you need a good Turkish grill.
"Good Turkish food with generous portions, a salad and two cooked onion dishes included with your main course. I have a large appetite and I was full up. We spent £8.50 per person (we ordered two main courses and had tap water). The food is also not too oily and does have very nice flavouring (unlike many of the Lebanese restaurants I have been to). So in other words, you do not feel like you are eating a chunk of meat! If you like your food, have a good appetite and are on a budget, this is the restaurant for you. The challenge for this restaurant is to avoid putting up prices, as others have done previously, once mentioned in the time-out guide."
